story of the Telephone in Great Britain. The series of books promised
in the Preface to the author&rsquo;s <cite>Municipal Ownership in Great

      <p>Upon inadequate consideration the Disraeli Ministry
      estimates at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 the cost of
      nationalization. Political expediency responsible for
      Government&rsquo;s inadequate investigation. The Government raises
      its estimate to $30,000,000; adding that it could afford
      to pay $40,000,000 to $50,000,000. Mr. Goschen, M. P., and
      Mr. Leeman, M. P., warn the House of Commons against the
      Government&rsquo;s estimates, which had been prepared by Mr.
      Scudamore. The Gladstone Ministry, relying on Mr. Scudamore,
      estimates at $3,500,000 the &ldquo;reversionary rights&rdquo; of the
      railway companies, for which rights the State ultimately paid
      $10,000,000 to $11,000,000.</p>

      <p> The completion of the telegraph system costs $8,500,000;
      Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s successive estimates had been respectively
      $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s brilliant forecast
      of the increase of traffic under public ownership. Mr.
      Scudamore&rsquo;s appalling blunder in predicting that the State
      telegraphs would be self-supporting. Operating expenses on the
      average exceed 92.5% of the gross earnings, in contrast to
      Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s estimate of 51% to 56%. The annual telegraph
      deficits aggregate 26.5% of the capital invested in the plant.
      The financial failure of the State telegraphs is not due to
      the large price paid to the telegraph companies and railway
      companies. The disillusionment of an eminent advocate of
      nationalization, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons.</p>

    <p>Sir S. Northcote, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Mr.
      Disraeli&rsquo;s Ministry of 1874 to 1880, is disillusioned. The
      State telegraphs become self-supporting in 1879-80. The House
      of Commons, under the leadership of Dr. Cameron, M. P., for
      Glasgow, overrides the Ministry and cuts the tariff almost in
      two. In 1890-91 the State telegraphs would again have become
      self-supporting, had not the House of Commons, under pressure
      from the civil service unions, increased wages and salaries.
      The necessity of making money is the only effective incentive
      to sound management.</p>

<p class="center">SCOPE OF THE INQUIRY</p>

<p>The story of the British State Telegraphs divides itself into two
parts: the purchase of the telegraphs, in 1870, from the companies
that had established the industry of telegraphy; and the subsequent
conduct of the business of telegraphy by the Government. The first
part is covered by Chapters II to VI; the second part by the remaining
chapters. Both parts contain a record of fact and experience that
should be of service to the American public at the present moment, when
there is before them the proposal to embark upon the policy of the
municipal ownership and operation of the so-called municipal public
service industries. The second part, however, will interest a wider
body of readers than the first part; for it deals with a question that
is of profound interest and importance at all times&mdash;the problem
of a large body of civil servants in a Democracy.</p>

<p>Chapters II to VI tell of the demand of the British Chambers of
Commerce, under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh,
for lower charges
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
on telegraphic messages; the appointment by the Government of Mr.
Scudamore, Second Secretary of the Post Office, to report upon the
relative merits of private telegraphs and State telegraphs; the
character of the report submitted by Mr. Scudamore; and the reasons
why that report&mdash;upon which rested the whole argument for
nationalization&mdash;was not adequately considered either by the
Select Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the Bill for the
purchase of the telegraphs was referred, or by the House of Commons
itself. The principal reason was that the agitation carried on by the
Chambers of Commerce and the newspaper press<a href="#Footnote_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> proved so successful that
both political parties committed themselves to nationalization before
Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s report had been submitted to searching criticism.
Under the circumstances, the Disraeli Ministry was unwilling to go into
the general election of 1868 without having made substantial progress
toward the nationalization of the telegraphs. In order to remove
opposition to its Bill in the House of Commons, the Disraeli Ministry
conceded practically everything asked by the telegraph companies, the
railway companies and the newspaper press.<a href="#Footnote_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The result was that the
Government paid a high price absolutely for the telegraphs. Whether the
price was too high, relatively speaking, is difficult to say. In the
first place,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the price paid&mdash;about $40,000,000&mdash;was well within
the sum which the Government had said it could afford to pay,
to wit, $40,000,000 to $50,000,000. In the second place, the
Government acquired an industry &ldquo;ready-made,&rdquo; with an
established staff of highly trained men educated in the school of
competition&mdash;the only school that thus far has proved itself
capable of bringing out the highest efficiency that is in men. In
the second place, the Government acquired the sole right to transmit
messages by electricity&mdash;a right which subsequent events have
proved to cover all future inventions, such as the transmission of
messages by means of the telephone and of wireless telegraphy. Finally,
in spite of the wastefulness that characterized the Government&rsquo;s
operation of the telegraphs from the day the telegraphs were taken
over, the Telegraph Department in the year 1880-81 became able to
earn more than the interest upon the large capital invested in the
telegraphs. But from that year on the Government not only became more
and more wasteful, but also lost control over the charges made to the
public for the transmission of messages. It is instructive to note, in
this latter connection, that the control over the rates to be charged
to the public was taken out of the hands of the Government by Dr.
Cameron, who represented in the House of Commons the people of Glasgow,
and that another Scotch city, Edinburgh, had initiated and maintained
the campaign for the nationalization of the telegraphs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary of the astounding incidents of
the campaign and negotiations that resulted in the purchase of the
telegraphs, was the fact that in the debates in the House of Commons
was not even raised the question of the possibility of complications
and dangers arising out of the multiplication of the civil servants.
That fact is the more remarkable, since the leaders of both political
parties at the time apprehended so much danger from the existing civil
servants that they refused to take active steps to enfranchise the
civil servants employed in the so-called revenue departments&mdash;the
customs, inland revenue and Post Office departments&mdash;who had been
disfranchised since the close of the Eighteenth Century. The Bill of
1868, which gave the franchise to the civil servants in question, was
a Private Bill, introduced by Mr. Monk, a private Member of the House
of Commons; and it was carried against the protest of the Disraeli
Ministry, and without the active support of the leading men in the
Opposition.</p>

<p>In the debates upon Mr. Monk&rsquo;s Bill, Mr. Gladstone, sitting in
Opposition, said he was not afraid that either political party ever
would try to use the votes of the civil servants for the purpose of
promoting its political fortunes, &ldquo;but he owned that he had some
apprehension of what might be called class influence in the House of
Commons, which in his opinion was the great reproach of the Reformed
Parliament, as he believed history would record. Whether they were
going to emerge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
into a new state of things in which class influence would be weaker,
he knew not; but that class influence had been in many things evil and
a scandal to them, especially for the last fifteen or twenty years
[since the Reform of Parliament]; and he was fearful of its increase in
consequence of the possession of the franchise, through the power which
men who, as members of a regular service, were already organized, might
bring to bear on Members of Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chapters VII and following show that Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
apprehensions were well-founded; that the civil servants have become
a class by themselves, with interests so widely divergent from the
interests of the rest of the community that they do not distribute
their allegiance between the two great political parties on the merits
of the respective policies of those parties, as do an equal number of
voters taken at random. The civil servants have organized themselves in
great civil service unions, for the purpose of promoting their class
interests by bringing pressure to bear upon the House of Commons. At
the parliamentary elections they tend to vote solidly for the candidate
who promises them most. In one constituency they will vote for the
Liberal candidate, in another for the Conservative candidate.</p>

<p>Thus far neither Party appears to have made an open or definite
alliance with the civil servants. But in the recent years in
which the Conservative Party was in power, and year after year
denied&mdash;&ldquo;on principle&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of public policy&mdash;certain requests of the civil servants,
the rank and file, as well as some of the minor leaders of the
Liberal, or Opposition Party, evinced a strong tendency to vote
rather solidly in the House of Commons in support of those demands
of the civil servants.<a href="#Footnote_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"
class="fnanchor">3</a> At the same time the chiefs of the Liberal, or
Opposition Party, refrained from the debate as well as from the vote.
It may be that the Opposition Party discipline was not strong enough
to enable the Opposition chiefs to prevent the votes on the momentous
issue raised in the House of Commons by the civil servants from
becoming for all practical purposes Party votes; or, it may be that the
Liberal Party leaders did not deem it expedient to seek to control the
voting of their followers. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the
Conservative Ministry that was in power, repeatedly called in vain upon
the House of Commons to take out of the field of Party politics the
issue raised by the civil servants in the period from 1890 to 1905. The
Conservative Ministry year after year denied the request of the Post
Office employees for a House of Commons Select Committee on the pay and
position of the Post Office employees. On the other hand, the support
of that request came steadily from the Liberal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Opposition. In the General Election of January, 1906, the Post Office
employees threw their weight overwhelmingly on the side of the Liberal
Party; and immediately after the opening of the new Parliament, the
newly established Liberal Government announced that it would give the
Post Office employees the House of Commons Select Committee which the
late Conservative Ministry had &ldquo;on principle&rdquo; of public
policy refused to grant.</p>

<p>Shortly after the General Election of January, 1906, the President
of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, a powerful political
organization, stated that nearly 450 of the 670 Members of the House
of Commons had pledged themselves, in the course of the campaign, to
vote for a House of Commons Select Committee. At about the same time,
Lord Balcarres, a Conservative whip in the late Balfour ministry,
speaking of the 281 members who entered Parliament for the first time
in 1906, said &ldquo;he thought he was fairly accurate when he said
that they had given pretty specific pledges upon this matter [of a
Select Committee] to those who had sent them to the House.&rdquo;
Sir Acland-Hood, chief whip in the late Balfour Ministry, added:
&ldquo;&hellip;nearly the whole of the supporters of the then [1905]
Government voted against the appointment of the Select Committee [in
July, 1905]. No doubt many of them suffered for it at the general
election; they either lost their seats or had their majorities reduced
in consequence of the vote.&rdquo; And the new Prime
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Minister, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, spoke of the &ldquo;retroactive
effect of old promises extracted in moments of agony from candidates at
the general election.&rdquo; And finally, at the annual conference of
the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, held in March, 1906, Mr.
R. S. Davis, the representative of the Metropolitan London Telegraph
Clerks, said: &ldquo;The new Postmaster General had made concessions
which had almost taken them [the postal clerks] off their feet by the
rapidity with which one had succeeded another and the manner in which
they were granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chapters XIV to XVII describe the efforts made by the civil servants
to secure exemption from the ordinary vicissitudes of life, as well
as exemption from the necessity of submitting to those standards of
efficiency and those rules of discipline which prevail in private
employment. They show the hopelessly unbusinesslike spirit of the rank
and file of the public servants, a spirit fostered by the practice of
members of the House of Commons intervening, from the floor of the
House as well as behind the scenes, on behalf of public servants who
have not been promoted, have been disciplined or dismissed, or, have
failed to persuade the executive officers to observe one or more of the
peculiar claims of &ldquo;implied contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;vested
right&rdquo; which make the British public service so attractive to
those men whose object in life is not to secure full and untrammeled
scope for their abilities and ambitions, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a haven of refuge from the ordinary vicissitudes of life. Members
of the House of Commons intervene, in the manner indicated, in mere
matters of detail of administration, because they have not the courage
to refuse to obey the behests of the political leaders of the civil
service unions; they do not so interfere from the mere desire to
promote their political fortunes by championing the interests of a
class. They recognize the fact that the art of government is the art of
log-rolling, of effecting the best compromise possible, under the given
conditions of political intelligence and public spirit, between the
interests of a class and the interests of the country as a whole. Their
views were forcibly expressed, on a recent occasion, by Captain Norton,
who long has been one of the most aggressive champions in the House of
Commons, of the civil servants, and who, at present, is a Junior Lord
of the Treasury, in the Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman Liberal Ministry.
Said Captain Norton: &ldquo;As regarded what had been said about undue
influence [being exercised by the civil servants], his contention was
that so long as the postal officials &hellip; were allowed to maintain
a vote, they had precisely the same rights as all other voters in the
country to exercise their fullest influence in the defense of their
rights, privileges and interests. He might mention that all classes of
all communities, of all professions, all trades, all combinations of
individuals, such as anti-vaccinationists and so forth, had invariably
used their utmost pressure in defense of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
interests and views upon members of the House&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The problem of government in every country&mdash;irrespectively
of the form which the political institutions may take in any given
country&mdash;is to avoid class legislation, and to make it impossible
for any one class to exploit the others. Some of us&mdash;who are
old-fashioned and at present in the minority&mdash;believe that
the solution of that problem is to be found only in the upbuilding
of the character and the intelligence of the individual citizen.
Others believe that it is to be found largely, if not mainly, in
extending the functions of the State and the City. To the writer, the
experience of Great Britain under the experiment of the extension
of the functions of the State and the City, seems to teach once
more the essential soundness of the doctrine that the nation that
seeks refuge from the ills that appear under the policy of <span
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span>, seeks refuge from such ills in the
apparently easy, and therefore tempting, device of merely changing
the form of its political institutions and political ideals, will but
change the form of the ills from which it suffers.</p>

for the Nationalization of the Telegraphs</span></h2>

The argument from foreign experience. The promise of reduced tariffs
and increased facilities. The alleged financial success of foreign
State telegraphs: Belgium, Switzerland and France. The argument from
British company experience.</p> </div>

<p>In 1856 the Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain, under the
leadership of the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh, began an agitation
for the purchase by the Government of the properties of the several
British telegraph companies. In 1865, the telegraph companies, acting
in unison, withdrew the reduced rate of twenty-four cents for twenty
words, address free, that had been in force, since 1861, between
certain large cities. That action, which will be described further on,
caused the Chambers of Commerce to increase the agitation for State
purchase. In September, 1865, Lord Stanley of Alderley, Postmaster
General, commissioned Mr. F. I. Scudamore, Second Secretary of the
Post Office, &ldquo;to inquire and report whether, in his opinion, the
electric telegraph service might be beneficially worked by the Post
Office&mdash;whether, if so worked, it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
would possess any advantages over a system worked by private
companies&mdash;and whether it would entail any very large expenditure
on the Post Office Department beyond the purchase of existing
rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In July, 1866, Mr. Scudamore reported, recommending the purchase
of the telegraphs. In February, 1868, he submitted a supplementary
report; and in 1868 and 1869, he acted as the chief witness for the
Government before the Parliamentary Committees appointed to report on
the Government&rsquo;s Bills proposing to authorize the State to acquire
and operate the telegraphs.<a href="#Footnote_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"
class="fnanchor">4</a> The extent to which the Government, throughout
the considerations and negotiations which finally ended in the
nationalization of the telegraphs, relied almost exclusively upon
evidence supplied by Mr. Scudamore, is indicated in the statement made
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, on July 21, 1868,
that Mr. Scudamore &ldquo;might be said to be the author of the Bill to
acquire the telegraphs.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"
class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Indictment of the Telegraph
Companies</em></div>

<p>Mr. Scudamore reported that the Chambers of Commerce, and the
various writers in the periodical and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
newspaper press who had supported the proposal of State purchase,
had concurred in the following general propositions: &ldquo;that
the charges made by the telegraph companies were too high, and
tended to check the growth of telegraphic correspondence; that there
were frequent delays of messages; that many important districts
were unprovided with telegraphic facilities; that in many places
the telegraph office was inconveniently remote from the centre of
business, and was open for too small a portion of the day; that little
or no improvement could be expected so long as the working of the
telegraphs was conducted by commercial companies striving chiefly to
earn a dividend and engaged in wasteful competition with each other;
and, finally, that the growth of telegraphic correspondence had been
greatly stimulated in Belgium and Switzerland by the annexation of the
telegraphs to the Post Offices of those countries, and the consequent
adoption of a low scale of charges; and that in Great Britain like
results would follow the adoption of like means, and that from the
annexation of the British telegraphs to the British Post Office there
would accrue great advantage to the public, and ultimately a large
revenue to the State.&rdquo; Subsequently, before the Select Committees
of Parliament, Mr. Scudamore maintained that in the hands of the State
the telegraphs would pay from the start.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore continued his report with the statement that he had
satisfied himself that in Great Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the telegraph was not in such general use as upon the Continent;
that &ldquo;the class who used the telegraphs most freely were stock
brokers, mining agents, ship brokers, Colonial brokers, racing and
betting men, fruit merchants and others engaged in business of a
speculative character, or who deal in articles of a perishable nature.
Even general merchants used the telegraphs comparatively little,
compared with those engaged in the more speculative branches of
commerce.&rdquo; He added that from 1862 to 1868 the annual increase
in the number of telegraphic messages had ranged pretty evenly from 25
per cent. to 30 per cent., indicating merely a gradual increase in the
telegraphic correspondence of those classes who had been the first to
use the telegraphs. He said there had been none of those &ldquo;sudden
and prodigious jumps&rdquo; that had occurred on the Continent after
each reduction in the charges for telegraphic messages, or after each
extension of the telegraph system to the smaller towns.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore held that it was a serious indictment of the manner
in which the telegraph companies had discharged their duties to the
public, that the small tradesman had not learned to order goods by
telegraph, and had not thereby enabled himself to get along with a
smaller stock of goods kept constantly on hand; that the fishing
villages on the remote coasts of Scotland that had no railways,
had no telegraphs; that the public did not send &ldquo;millions
of messages&rdquo; of this kind: &ldquo;I shall not be home to
dinner;&rdquo; &ldquo;I will bring down some fish;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
&ldquo;You can meet me at four;&rdquo; and that the wife and children,
away from their home in the country village, did not telegraph
to the husband and father: &ldquo;Send me a money order.&rdquo;
Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s notions of the uses to which the telegraphs
ought to be put were shared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr. Hunt, who looked forward to the day when &ldquo;persons who
have a difficulty in writing letters will have less difficulty in
going to a telegraph office and sending a message to a friend than
writing a letter.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"
class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Argument from Foreign Experience</em></div>

<p>Mr. Scudamore supported his position with the subjoined reports
from countries in which the State operated the telegraphs. The Danish
Government had reported that the telegraph was used by merchants
generally and for social and domestic purposes. Prussia had reported
that in the early days, when the charges had been high, the use of the
telegraph had been confined almost exclusively to bankers, brokers,
large commercial houses and newspaper correspondents, but that with
each reduction in the charges, or extension of the telegraphs to small
towns, the number of those who regularly sent out and received messages
had increased considerably. Switzerland had reported that messages
relating to personal business and family affairs formed as important
a part of the whole traffic as the messages of banking interests and
other trading interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>France had reported that 38 per cent. of the messages related to
personal business and family affairs; and Belgium had reported that
nearly 59 per cent. of the messages related to personal business and
family affairs.</p>

<p>To indicate the manner in which the use of the telegraph increased
with reductions in the charges made, Mr. Scudamore reported that in
Belgium, in 1863, a reduction of 33 per cent. in the charge had been
followed by an increase of 80 per cent. in the number of telegrams;
and that, in 1866, a reduction of 50 per cent. in the charges had been
followed by an increase of 85 per cent. in the traffic. In France, in
1862, a reduction of 35 per cent. in the charge, had led to an increase
of 64 per cent. in the number of messages. In Switzerland, in 1868, a
reduction of 50 per cent. in the charge had been followed, in the next
three months, by an increase in business of 90 per cent. In Prussia,
in 1867, a reduction of the charge by 33 per cent. had, in the first
month, increased the number of messages by 70 per cent. The increase in
business always had followed immediately, said Mr. Scudamore, showing
that new classes of people took up the use of the telegraphs.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Scudamore stated that in 1866, the proportion borne by
the total of telegrams sent to the aggregate of letters sent, had been:
in Belgium, one telegram for every 37 letters; in Switzerland, one
telegram for every 69 letters; and in the United Kingdom, one telegram
for every 121 letters. The relative failure of the people of the United
Kingdom to use the telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
freely, Mr. Scudamore ascribed to the high charges made by the
telegraph companies, and to the restricted facilities offered by the
companies.</p>

<p>In 1868, the British companies were charging 24 cents for a
twenty-word message, over distances not exceeding 100 miles; 36 cents
for distances between 100 and 200 miles; and 48 cents for distances
exceeding 200 miles. For messages passing between Great Britain and
Ireland, the charge ranged from $0.72 to $1.44. In all cases the
addresses of the sender and of the sendee were carried free.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>Promise of Lower Charges and Better
Service</em></div>

<p>The Government proposed to make a uniform charge of 24 cents for
twenty words, irrespective of distance. Mr. Scudamore stated that
he fully expected that in two or three years the Government would
reduce its charge to 12 cents. The only reason why the Government did
not propose to adopt immediately the last mentioned rate, was the
desire not to overcrowd the telegraphs at the start before there had
been the chance to learn with what volume of traffic the existing
plant and staff could cope.<a href="#Footnote_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"
class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>In 1868 there was in the United Kingdom one telegraph office
for every 13,000 people. The Government promised to inaugurate the
nationalization of the telegraphs by giving one office for every 6,000
people.<a href="#Footnote_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
In the shortest time possible, the Government would open a telegraph
office at every money order issuing Post Office. At that time the
practice was to establish a money order office wherever there was the
prospect of two money orders being issued a day; and in some instances
such offices were established on the prospect of one order a day.</p>

<p>The contention that the public interest demanded a great increase
in the number of telegraph offices, Mr. Scudamore supported by citing
the number of offices in Belgium and France. In the former country
there were upward of 125 telegraph offices which despatched less than
one telegram a day. In fact, some offices despatched less than one a
month. The Belgium Government, in figuring the cost of the Telegraph
Department, charged that Department nothing whatever for office rent,
or for fire, light and office fittings; nor did it charge the smaller
offices anything for the time given by the State Railway employees and
the postal employees to the Telegraph Department. In France there were
301 telegraph offices that took in less than $40 a year; 179 offices
that took in from $40 to $100; and 185 offices that took in from $100
to $200.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore over and again assured the Parliamentary Select
Committee of 1868 that the telegraphs in the hands of the State would
be self-supporting from the start, and that ultimately they would be a
considerable source of revenue. But he supported his indictment of the
telegraph companies of the United Kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by drawing upon the experience of the State telegraphs of Belgium,
Switzerland, and France, under very low rates on inland telegrams,
as distinguished from telegrams in transit, or telegrams to and from
foreign countries. In taking that course, Mr. Scudamore ignored the
fact that the inland rates in question were not remunerative.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Belgium&rsquo;s Experience</em></div>

<p>The Belgium State telegraphs had been opened in 1850. In the years
1850 to 1856, they had earned, upon an average, 36.8 per cent. a year
upon their cost. In the period 1857 to 1862, they had earned, upon an
average, 24.3 per cent. In 1863 to 1865, the annual earnings fell to an
average of 13.5 per cent.; and in 1866 to 1869, they reached an average
of 2.8 per cent. only. The reasons for that rapid and steady decline of
the net earnings were: the opening of relatively unprofitable lines and
offices; increases in wages which the Government could not withhold;
a slackening in the rate of growth of the profits on the so-called
foreign messages and transit messages; and a rapid increase in the
losses upon the inland messages, which were carried at low rates for
the purpose of stimulating traffic.</p>

<p>At an early date the Belgium Government concluded that the first
three of the four factors just enumerated were beyond the control of
the State, and therefore permanent. It resolved, therefore, to attempt
to neutralize them by developing the inland traffic to such proportions
that it should become a source of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
profit, that traffic having been, up to that time, a source of loss.
Accordingly, on January 1st, 1863, the Government lowered the charge
on inland messages from 30 cents for 20 words, addresses included, to
20 cents. As that reduction did not prove sufficiently effective, the
charge on inland messages was reduced, on December 1st, 1865, to 10
cents for 20 words. Under that reduction the loss incurred upon the
inland messages rose from an annual average of $13,800 in 1863 to 1865,
to an annual average of $59,500 in 1866 to 1869; and the average annual
return upon the capital invested fell to 2.8 per cent. This evidence
was before Mr. Scudamore when he argued from the experience of Belgium
in favor of a uniform rate, irrespective of distance, of 24 cents for
20 words, not counting the addresses. Mr. Scudamore shared the opinion
of the Belgium Government that the rate of 10 cents would so stimulate
the traffic as to become very profitable. As a matter of fact, things
went from bad to worse in Belgium, and for many years the Belgian State
telegraphs failed to earn operating expenses.<a href="#Footnote_9_9"
id="FNanchor_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>By way of explanation it should be added that the so-called transit
messages and foreign messages were profitable for two reasons. In
the first place, the Belgian Government kept high the rates on those
messages. In the second place, those messages are carried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
much more cheaply than inland messages. The transit messages, say
from Germany to England, have only to be retransmitted; they are not
received across the counter, nor are they delivered across the counter
and by messenger. The foreign messages are burdened with only one of
the two foregoing relatively costly operations. In 1866 the Belgian
Government stated that, if the cost to the Telegraph Department
of a given number of words transmitted as a message in transit be
represented by two, the corresponding cost of the same number of words
received and transmitted as a foreign message would be represented by
three, while the cost of the same number of words received
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and transmitted as an inland message would be represented by five.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Swiss Experience</em></div>

<p>The Swiss State telegraphs, the experience of which Mr. Scudamore
also cited in support of his Report, were opened in 1852; and in the
period from 1854 to 1866 they earned, on an average, 18 per cent. upon
their cost. Throughout that period the average receipts per inland
messages were 21 cents, and the average receipts per foreign message
were 39 cents. In the year 1865 the average receipts per message were
21 cents for inland messages, and 30 cents for foreign and transit
messages, which constituted 39 per cent. of the traffic. In the
following year, 1866, the average receipts upon the inland traffic
remained unchanged; while those upon the foreign and transit traffic,
43 per cent. of the total traffic, fell to 20 cents. This reduction
of 33 per cent. in the average receipts upon the foreign and transit
traffic, caused a decline of 45 per cent. in the total net receipts,
and reduced the earnings upon the capital from 15.2 per cent. in 1865,
to 7.5 per cent. in 1866.</p>

<p>Thus far the receipts from the inland messages had not covered the
operating expenses incurred on account of those messages. The profits,
which had been very large, had come from the foreign messages and
messages in transit.<a href="#Footnote_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"
class="fnanchor">10</a> The Government, alarmed at the decline in
profits resulting from the fall in the average
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
receipts per message in the foreign and transit traffic, resolved
upon a special effort to stimulate the growth of the inland traffic.
Accordingly, on January 1st, 1868, it lowered the rates on inland
messages of 20 words, address counted, from 20 cents to 10 cents. The
inland traffic immediately doubled; but the cost of handling it more
than doubled. The increase in the traffic necessitated the stringing
of additional wires, and the employment of more instruments, linemen,
telegraphers and office clerks. At the same time the Government
was obliged to concede all round increases of wages and salaries,
in consequence of the general increase in the cost of living which
accompanied the world-wide revival of trade ushered in by the discovery
of gold in California and Australia, the introduction of steamships
upon the high seas, and the building of railways in all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>The inland messages increased by leaps and bounds from 397,289 in
1867 to 2,118,373 in 1876; and still the receipts from them did not
cover the operating expenses. In 1874 and 1875, for example, those
expenses averaged 14 cents per message. Accordingly, in 1877, the
Government adopted a new scale of charges on inland messages, to wit:
an initial charge of 6 cents per message, to which was added 0.5 cent
for every word transmitted. The Government assumed that the average
length of the inland messages would be 14 words; and that the average
receipts per message would be 13 cents. It hoped soon to reduce
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the average cost per message below 13 cents, and hoped thus to
make the inland traffic remunerative. But those expectations never
were realized; and to this day the inland messages have been
carried at a loss.<a href="#Footnote_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"
class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>French Experience</em></div>

<p>In 1861, the French State telegraphs reduced the rate for messages
of 20 words, counting the address, to 20 cents for intradepartmental<a
href="#Footnote_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
messages, and to 40 cents for interdepartmental messages. In 1866 the
average receipts per message were: 38 cents on the inland traffic;
$1.38 on the foreign traffic; and 55.8 cents on the traffic as a whole.
With these average receipts per message, the earnings were $1,541,519;
while the operating expenses were $1,796,692. In other words, the State
telegraphs lost $255,173 on the working, besides failing to earn any
interest on the capital invested in them, $4,760,000.</p>

<p>In making the foregoing statement, no allowance is made for
the value of the messages sent &ldquo;on public service,&rdquo;
messages for which the State would have been obliged to pay, had the
telegraphs been owned or operated by companies. No such allowance can
be made, because the several official French statements submitted
by Mr. Scudamore as to the number of messages sent &ldquo;on public
service&rdquo; applied to the years 1865 and 1867, years for which the
operating expenses were not given.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Furthermore, the messages sent on public service in 1865 and 1867
were so numerous as to indicate so loose a construction of the term
&ldquo;on public service&rdquo; as to make the returns worthless for
the purpose of determining the commercial value of the saving resulting
to the State from the public ownership of the telegraphs. For 1865,
the number of messages &ldquo;on public service&rdquo; was returned
as 568,647, the equivalent of 23 per cent. of the number of messages
sent by the public. For 1867, the number was returned as 168,999, the
equivalent of 5.94 per cent. of the messages sent by the public. That
those figures represented an unreasonable resource to the telegraph
for the transaction of the State&rsquo;s business, is proved by the
fact that in the United Kingdom, in the period 1871 to 1890, the value
of the messages sent &ldquo;on public service&rdquo; was equivalent
to less than 2 per cent. of the sums paid by the public for the
transmission of telegraphic messages. On the basis of any reasonable
use of the telegraphs &ldquo;on public service,&rdquo; the financial
results of the French State telegraphs would not have been altered
materially. The deficit, in 1866, on account of operating expenses,
$255,173, was sufficient to permit of the sending of 457,300 messages
&ldquo;on public service,&rdquo; the equivalent of 16 per cent. of the
messages sent by the public. It would be unreasonable to assume that
the State could have need of such recourse to the telegraphs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Summary of Foreign Experience</em></div>

<p>To sum up the evidence from Belgium, Switzerland,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and France, submitted by Mr. Scudamore in 1866 to 1869: This evidence
was that rates of 20 cents and 10 cents for 20 words, applied to inland
messages, developed an enormous inland traffic, but that that traffic
was unremunerative. So long as the rates on foreign messages and
transit messages had remained very much higher than the rates on inland
messages, the Belgian and Swiss State telegraphs had paid handsomely.
But as soon as the latter rates had approached the level of the former
rates, the net revenue had tumbled headlong; and there was, in 1868 and
1869, no certainty that it would not disappear entirely, or be reduced
to such proportions as no longer to afford an adequate return upon the
capital invested in the telegraphs. In the case of France, no evidence
was presented that the State telegraphs ever had paid their way, though
the prices obtained for the transmission of foreign messages and
transit messages were between three and four times the returns obtained
from the transmission of inland messages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>English Companies&rsquo; Experience</em></div>

<p>While the evidence from Belgium, Switzerland and France, presented
by Mr. Scudamore, did not support the proposition of a low uniform
rate, irrespective of distance, the evidence furnished by the
experience of the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom pointed
strongly to the conclusion that a uniform rate, irrespective of
distance, of 24 cents for 20 words, addresses not counted, was not
remunerative in the then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
state of efficiency of the telegraph. In this connection it must be
borne in mind that at this time messages had to be retransmitted at
intervals of 200 or 300 miles; and that, while the maximum distance a
message could travel was only 160 miles in Belgium, and 200 miles in
Switzerland, it was 600 miles in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In 1861 the telegraph business of the United Kingdom was in the
hands of two companies which had been organized in 1846 and 1852
respectively: the Electric and International Telegraph Company, and the
British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company. In that year, 1861, a new
company, the United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company, invaded the
field with a uniform tariff, irrespective of distance, of 24 cents for
20 words, addresses free. The established companies had been charging
24 cents for distances up to 25 miles; 36 cents for distances up to 50
miles; 48 cents for distances up to 100 miles; 60 cents for distances
up to 200 miles; 96 cents for distances up to 300 miles; and $1.20 for
distances up to 400 miles.<a href="#Footnote_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"
class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The United Kingdom Company began operations in 1861 with a trunk
line between London, Birmingham,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Manchester, Liverpool and intermediate and neighboring towns. Shortly
afterward it opened a second trunk line from London to Northampton,
Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, Leeds and Hull;
and across through Bradford, Halifax, Rochdale, and Huddersfield to
Manchester and Liverpool. Subsequently the company extended its line to
Edinburgh and Glasgow, thus lengthening to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
upward of 500 miles, the distance over which messages were transmitted
for 24 cents.<a href="#Footnote_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"
class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In July 1865, the Board of Directors reported as follows to
the stockholders: &ldquo;The Directors much regret to state that,
notwithstanding their earnest efforts to develop telegraphic
communication so as to render the shilling [24 cent] rate remunerative,
the company has been unable to earn a dividend. The system of the
company consists of trunk lines almost exclusively embracing nearly
all the main centres of business, telegraphically speaking, of the
country. Seeing that the company was working under the greatest
possible advantages, and that upward of four years had elapsed since
the formation of the company without the payment of any dividend to the
proprietary, the directors conceived that they would not be justified
in continuing the shilling [24 cent] system, and arrangements were
therefore agreed to for its alteration. The directors waited until
the last moment before reluctantly adopting this step, but having
sought publicity in every way, having persistently canvassed in every
department of business,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and having endeavored by personal solicitations of numerous
active agents to attract trade, they at last saw themselves
compelled to agree to a measure that was greatly antagonistic
to their personal wishes, but absolutely essential for the
well-being of the company, and requisite, as they believe, for the
<del>premanent</del><ins>permanent</ins> interests of the telegraphing
community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1865, the United Kingdom Telegraph Company joined with its
competitors, the Electric and International Telegraph Company, and the
British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company, in the following rates
for 20 words, addresses free: 24 cents for distances up to 100 miles;
36 cents for distances between 100 and 200 miles; and 48 cents for
distances beyond 200 miles.</p>

<p>In July, 1866, the directors of the United Kingdom Telegraph Company
reported that in the last half-year &ldquo;the company earned an amount
of profit equal to 6 per cent. dividend over the whole of its share
capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the United Kingdom Company had entered the field, in 1861,
with the 24 cent rate, the old established companies, the Electric and
International and the British and Irish Magnetic, had been compelled
to adopt the 24 cent rate between all points reached by the United
Kingdom Company. In February, 1863, the directors of the Electric and
International Company reported that the 24 cent circuit between London,
Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham still was unremunerative.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
The company was losing money on every message transmitted, though the
24 cent rate had increased business to such an extent that the company
had been obliged to add two wires to the circuit in question. Since
the business done by means of the additional wires did not pay, the
directors had charged the cost of those wires to operating expenses,
not to capital account. The company did not care for the business, but
could not refuse to take it. In July, 1865, the directors reported:
&ldquo;After a trial of four years, the experiment of a uniform
shilling rate [on certain circuits] irrespective of distance, has not
justified itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The half yearly reports of the British and Irish Magnetic
Company from 1862 to 1865 reported that &ldquo;for any but very
short distances,&rdquo; the 24 cent tariff was &ldquo;utterly
unremunerative.&rdquo; The effect of the rate was to absorb in
unavoidable additional expenses a very large portion of the increase in
revenue coming from the increase in business.</p>

<p>In 1859 the London District Telegraph Company was organized for
the purpose of transmitting telegraph messages between points in
Metropolitan London. In 1860 the company had 52 stations and 73.5 miles
of line; and it carried 74,582 messages. In 1862 it had 84 offices and
103 miles of line, and it carried 243,849 messages. In 1865 the company
reached its highest point, carrying 316,272 messages. The company at
that time had 123 miles of line and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
83 offices. The London District Telegraph Company began with a tariff
of 8 cents for 10 words, and 12 cents for a message of 10 words
with a reply message of 10 words. It soon changed its tariff to 12
cents for 15 words, experience having shown that 10 words was an
insufficient allowance.<a href="#Footnote_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"
class="fnanchor">15</a> Subsequently the company added porterage
charges for delivery beyond a certain distance. In 1866, the company
raised its tariff to 24 cents. The company never earned operating
expenses; and in November, 1867, its shares, upon which $25 had been
paid in, fluctuated between $3.75 and $6.25.<a href="#Footnote_16_16"
id="FNanchor_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Mr. Robert Grimston, Chairman of the Electric and International
Telegraph Company, in 1868 commented as follows upon the experience of
the London District Telegraph Company. &ldquo;A very strong argument
against the popular fancy that the introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of a low rate of charge in towns and country districts would induce the
shopkeepers and the lower classes to use the telegraph is furnished
by the example of the London District Telegraph Company. A better
or a wider field than the metropolitan for an illustration of this
theory could not surely be furnished. The facts, however, being, that
after several years of struggling existence, the tariff being first
fixed at 8 cents, and then at 12 cents, the company has never paid its
way.&rdquo;</p>

      distances beyond 100 miles.</p>

   CHAPTER III <br /><span class="smcap">The Alleged Break-down of
   <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez-Faire</span></span>
</h2>

<div class="blockquot"> <p>Early history of telegraphy in Great
Britain. The adequacy of private enterprise. Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s
loose use of statistics. Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s test of adequacy of
facilities. Telegraphic charges and growth of traffic in Great Britain.
The alleged wastefulness of competition. The telegraph companies&rsquo;
proposal.</p> </div>

<p>Upon the foregoing evidence, taken from the experience of the State
telegraphs of Belgium, Switzerland, and France, and from the experience
of the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom, Mr. Scudamore
reached the conclusion that in telegraphy, in the United Kingdom,
private enterprise had broken down. He stated his conclusion in these
words: &ldquo;It is clearly shown, I think, &hellip; that the cardinal
distinction between the telegraph system of the United Kingdom and
the systems of Belgium and Switzerland is this: that the latter have
been framed and maintained solely with a view to the accommodation of
the public, whilst the former has been devised and maintained mainly
with a view to the interests of shareholders, and only indirectly
for the benefit of the public.&rdquo; These words were intended to
convey, and they did convey, the meaning that the policy of <span
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span> had broken
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
down. That policy rests on the assumption that in the long run, and
upon the whole, the public interest is conserved and promoted by the
activities of the individual citizens who are seeking to promote their
personal fortunes&mdash;by the activities of &ldquo;the mere speculator
and dividend seeker&rdquo;&mdash;to employ the phrase that came into
common use in 1866 to 1869, and ever since, has been made to do yeoman
service.</p>

<p>Let us test by the evidence&mdash;of which a large part is to
be found tucked away in the appendices to Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s
reports&mdash;this conclusion that in telegraphy, in the United
Kingdom, private enterprise had broken down, and the policy of <span
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span> had been discredited.</p>

<p>The first thing to note in this connection is, that in the case
of telegraphy, as in the case of so many other British industries,
public ownership has been a parasite. It has been unwilling to assume
the risk and burden of establishing the industry, and has contented
itself with purchasing &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; the industry after it
had been developed by private enterprise. When Mr. Ronalds attempted
to interest the British Government in telegraphy, he was told
&ldquo;that the telegraph was of no use in times of peace, and that the
semaphore in time of war answered all the required purposes.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>In 1837, British individuals and companies began to stake their
money upon the telegraph in Great Britain; and in 1854 they even
carried the telegraph industry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to continental Europe, notably to Belgium. In 1850 and 1851, the
Governments of France, Belgium and Switzerland, profiting by the losses
suffered, and the technical advances made, by British individuals and
companies, appropriated, so far as their countries were concerned, the
new industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>History of British Telegraphy</em></div>

<p>The Electric and International Telegraph Company was formed in 1846,
out of the reorganization of properties, that in 1837 had embarked
in telegraphy in England, and in 1845 had carried the telegraph
industry to Belgium.<a href="#Footnote_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"
class="fnanchor">18</a> At this time the use of the telegraph was
confined almost exclusively to railway purposes, such as train
signalling. The possibility of use for commercial purposes was so
little appreciated by the public, that the Electric and International
Company, after purchasing, in 1846, Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone&rsquo;s
inventions, was looked upon as a complete commercial failure. The
shares of the company for several years were almost valueless;
the chief source of revenue then being contracts obtained from
railway companies for the construction and maintenance of railway
telegraphs.</p>

<p>Between 1846 and 1851 great improvements were made in telegraphy,
and the public gradually learned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to use the telegraph. In 1849 the Electric and International declared
its first dividend, mainly the result of the contracts with the railway
companies. In November, 1851, a cable was laid between Dover and
Calais; for the first time the prices of the stock exchange securities
in Paris were known the same day within business hours on the London
stock exchange; and the financial and trading interests became
convinced of the value of the telegraph.<a href="#Footnote_19_19"
id="FNanchor_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The Electric and International Company began in 1846 with a capital,
paid in, of $700,000, which had been increased, by the close of 1868,
to $5,849,375. The company grew steadily, and in 1867 it had 10,000
miles of line, and 49,600 miles of wire. In March, 1856, when the
company had a record of five years for dividends ranging from 6 to
6.5 per cent. on the capital paid in, the stock of the company was
selling at 80, which showed that the investing public deemed the
returns inadequate, considering the risks attaching to the business.
In January, 1863, when the company had a record of three years as a
7 per cent. company, the stock still stood under par&mdash;at 99.5.
In 1864 the company paid 8 per cent., in 1865 it paid 9 per cent.,
and in 1866 to 1868 it paid 10 per cent.<a href="#Footnote_20_20"
id="FNanchor_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in 1857
by amalgamation of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, organized in 1851,
and the British Telegraph Company,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
organized in 1852. In March, 1856, the Magnetic had a paid up capital
of $1,500,000, which was worth 60 cents on the dollar; and the British
Company had a paid up capital of $1,170,000, which was worth 47.5 cents
on the dollar. In January, 1864, the amalgamated company was paying
4.5 per cent., and its shares were worth 62.5. In 1865 the British
and Irish raised the dividend to 5 per cent.; in 1866 to 6 per cent.,
and in 1867 to 7.5 per cent. In 1866 the stock sold at 78 to 90; and
in 1867 at 90 to 97. In 1867 the company had 4,696 miles of line, and
18,964 miles of wire.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Telegraph Company was organized in 1860, and
began operations in 1861. In November, 1867, its shares were worth from
25 cents to 35 cents on the dollar. At that time the company had 1,692
miles of line, and about 9,827 miles of wire.</p>

<p>The London District Telegraph Company, which subsequently became
the London and Provincial, began business in 1860 with 52 offices in
Metropolitan London. In 1862 it increased the number of its offices to
84; and at the time of its sale to the State, it had 95 offices. The
company never earned operating expenses. It began by charging 8 cents
for 10 words; later on it charged 12 cents for 15 words; and in 1866 it
raised its charge to 24 cents.</p>

<p>Very little new capital was invested by the telegraph companies
after 1865, because of &ldquo;the very natural reluctance of the
companies to extend the systems
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
under their control so long as the proposal of the acquisition of those
systems by the State was under consideration,&rdquo; to use the words
of Mr. Scudamore.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Adequate Results of Private
Enterprise</em></div>

<p>The foregoing facts show that private enterprise was ready
throughout the period beginning with 1838 to incur considerable risks
in establishing the new industry of telegraphy, and in giving to the
public facilities for the use of that industry. Private enterprise
did not at any time adopt the policy of exploiting the public by
confining itself to operations involving little or no risk, while
paying well. It is true that once a company had reached the position
of paying 5, 6, 7, 8, or more, per cent., it tried to maintain that
position, and refrained from making extensions at such a rate as to
cause a decrease in the dividend. But that fact does not warrant the
charge that the companies neglected their duty to the public. Until the
threat of purchase by the State arrested extensions, and the dividends
rose unusually rapidly, the earnings of the companies were moderate;
and finally, though the companies tried to maintain whatever rate of
dividend had once been attained, the investing public never believed
that even the Electric and International would maintain indefinitely
the 10 per cent. rate. That is shown by the fact that until the public
began to speculate on the strength of the prospect of the State paying
a big price for the property of the Electric and International, the
stock of that company never sold for more than 14
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
years&rsquo; purchase.<a href="#Footnote_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"
class="fnanchor">21</a> Had the public believed that the 10 per cent.
dividend would be maintained indefinitely, the stock would have risen
to 25 years&rsquo; purchase, the price of the best railway shares.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s Statistics</em></div>

<p>In order to show that the people of the United Kingdom suffered
from a lack of telegraphic facilities, when compared with the people
of Belgium and Switzerland, Mr. Scudamore stated in his reports of
1865 and 1866, that there were: in Belgium, 17.75 miles of telegraph
line to every 100 square miles; in Switzerland, 13.7; and in the
United Kingdom, 11.3. He stated, also, that there were in Belgium 6.33
telegraph offices to every 100,000 people; in Switzerland, 9.9; and in
the United Kingdom, 5.6.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore obtained the figures with regard to the United
Kingdom from the Board of Trade returns.<a href="#Footnote_22_22"
id="FNanchor_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> For 1865 to 1867, those
returns were very incomplete; but in 1868 they became very full. Mr.
Scudamore&rsquo;s reports of 1865 and 1868 were not ordered, by the
House of Commons, to be printed, until April, 1868, when the completed
Board of Trade returns were available. But neither in the reports as
laid before Parliament, nor in the testimony given before the Select
Committee of Parliament in 1868, did
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Mr. Scudamore draw attention to the fact that the statement that the
United Kingdom had only 11.3 miles of telegraph line to every 100
square miles of area, and 5.6 telegraph offices to every 100,000
people, was based on incomplete returns.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade return for 1868 stated that the Lancashire and
Yorkshire Railway Company had 432 miles of telegraph lines and that
various other companies not enumerated in 1865, had, in 1868, 3,665
miles of line. If it be assumed that in the period from 1865 to 1868
the Lancashire and the other railway companies not enumerated in 1865,
increased their net at the same rate as did the three railway companies
that were enumerated in 1865, namely, 11 per cent.,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
there must have been, in 1865, not less than 3,825 miles of telegraph
line of which Mr. Scudamore took no account in fixing the total mileage
at 16,066 miles. If it be further assumed that one-third of the
3,825 miles in question paralleled telegraph lines of the telegraph
companies, there were left out of account in 1865 by Mr. Scudamore
2,550 miles of telegraph line, the equivalent of 2.1 miles per 100
square miles of area. On the foregoing assumptions the mileage that
should have been assigned to the United Kingdom in 1865 was not 11.3,
but 13.4.</p>

<p>Considerations similar to the foregoing ones, when applied to Mr.
Scudamore&rsquo;s statement that there were, in 1865, 2,040 telegraph
stations, show that there probably were 2,680 telegraph stations in
1865, a full allowance being made for duplication. The last named
figure would have been equivalent to 8.9 telegraph offices for every
100,000 people as against 5.6 reported by Mr. Scudamore.</p>

<p>The foregoing corrections probably err in the direction of
understating the telegraph facilities existent in the United Kingdom
in 1865. These corrected results show that in the matter of telegraph
line per 100 square miles of area, the United Kingdom was abreast of
Switzerland in 1865, though considerably behind Belgium; and that,
in the matter of telegraph offices per 100,000 people, it was almost
abreast of Switzerland, and considerably in advance of Belgium.</p>

<p>In this connection it is helpful to note that in 1875,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
after the British Government had spent about $12,500,000 in rearranging
and extending the telegraph lines, as against Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s
estimate of 1868 that $1,500,000 would suffice for all rearrangements
and extensions, the number of miles of telegraph line per 100 square
miles of area was, 20 in the United Kingdom, and 27.4 in Belgium.<a

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s Standards of
Service</em></div>

<p>Mr. Scudamore submitted several other arguments in support of the
statement that private enterprise had failed to provide the public with
sufficient telegraphic facilities. He submitted a list of 486 English
and Welsh towns, ranging in population from 2,000 to 200,000, and
stated in each case whether or not the town was a telegraph station;
and if it was one, whether the telegraph office was, or was not, within
the town limits. Mr. Scudamore summarized the facts elucidated, with
the statement that 30 per cent. of the 486 towns were well served; that
40 per cent. were indifferently served; that 12 per cent. were badly
served; that 18 per cent. were not served at all; and that the towns
not served at all had an aggregate population of more than 500,000.<a
href="#Footnote_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore did not define his standards of good service,
indifferent service, bad service, and absence of service; but
examination of his data shows that his standards were so rigorous that
the state of affairs revealed in his summary was by no means so bad
as might appear at first sight. Mr. Scudamore took as the standard
of good service, the presence of a telegraph office within the town
limits. He characterized as indifferent the service of 98 towns in
which the telegraph office was within one-quarter of a mile of the
Post Office, though outside of the town limits; as well as the service
of 88 towns in which the telegraph office was within one-half a mile
of the Post Office, though outside of the town limits. He called the
service bad in the case of 38 towns in which the telegraph office was
within three-quarters of a mile of the Post Office; as well as in the
case of 22 towns in which the telegraph office was one mile from the
Post Office. He said there was no service whenever the distance of
the telegraph office from the Post Office exceeded one mile. In this
connection it should be added that the telegraph lines followed the
railway; and that in consequence of the prejudice against railway
companies in the early days, very many cities and towns refused to
allow the railway to enter the city or town limits.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s data showed that there had been in 1865 not
less than 96 towns in which the distance between the Post Office and
the nearest telegraph office exceeded one mile. In a foot-note, in the
appendix,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Mr. Scudamore stated that in 1868, not less than 25 of the 96 towns had
been given a railway telegraph office; but no mention of that fact did
he make in the main body of the report, the only part of the document
likely to be read even by the comparatively small number of the Members
of Parliament who took the trouble to read the document at all. As
for the writers of the newspaper press, and the general public, they
accepted without exception the statement that in 1868 not less than 18
per cent. of the towns in question, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
aggregate population of over 500,000, had no telegraphic service.
As a matter of fact the statement applied only to 14.6 per
cent. of the towns, with an aggregate population of 388,000;<a
href="#Footnote_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
and many of the towns that still were without service in 1868 would
not have been in that condition, had not the agitation for the
nationalization of the telegraphs arrested the investment of capital in
telegraphs in the years 1865 to 1868.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore also submitted a table giving the total number
of places with money order issuing Post Offices in England and
Wales, Scotland and Ireland; and stated what number of those
places had respectively perfect telegraph accommodation, imperfect
telegraphic accommodation, and no telegraphic accommodation.<a
href="#Footnote_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Mr.
Scudamore contended that the public interest demanded that each one of
those places should have at least one telegraph office, that office to
be located as near the centre of population as was the Post Office. He
submitted no argument in support
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of that proposition. But Parliament and the public accepted the
proposition with avidity, since Mr. Scudamore promised that the
extension required to give such a service would not cost more than
$1,000,000, about 1/11 or 1/12 of the total sum invested by the several
telegraph companies. Mr. Scudamore also promised that, after the
service had been thus extended, the total operating expenses of the
State telegraphs would be less than 45 per cent. of the gross receipts;
that the State telegraphs would at least pay their way, and that
they probably would yield a handsome profit. But when Mr. Scudamore
came to extend the State telegraphs, he spent upon extensions, not
$1,000,000, but about $8,500,000, and when the State came to operate
the telegraphs, the operating expenses quickly ran up to 87 per cent.
of the gross receipts in three years, 1874 to 1876. These errors of
Mr. Scudamore justify the statement that he made no case whatever
against the system of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span>, or private
ownership, on the ground of the extent of the facilities offered to the
public, under the system of private ownership. For obviously it was
one thing to condemn the telegraph companies for not building certain
extensions, those extensions being estimated to cost only $1,000,000,
and a different thing altogether to condemn the telegraph companies for
refusing to build out of hand extensions that would cost $8,500,000 and
would be relatively unremunerative, if not absolutely unprofitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tariffs and Growth of Traffic</em></div>

<p>It remains to consider whether the facts as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
charges made by the telegraph companies for the transmission of
messages, and the facts as to the rate of increase in the number
of messages transmitted, supported Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s contention
that the system of private ownership of the telegraphs had failed to
conserve and promote the public interest.</p>

<p>In 1851, the Electric and International Telegraph Company carried
99,216 messages, receiving on an average $2.41 per message. In 1856,
the year in which the Scotch Chambers of Commerce began the agitation
for nationalization, the company carried 812,323 messages, receiving on
an average $0.99 per message. In 1865, the year in which the telegraph
companies abolished the rate of 24 cents, irrespective of distance,
that had been in force between the leading cities, and the Chambers
of Commerce increased the agitation for purchase by the State, the
Electric and International carried 2,971,084 messages, receiving on an
average $0.49 a message. In the period from 1851 to 1867, the messages
carried by the company increased on an average by 28.76 per cent. a
year; the average receipts per message decreased on an average by 7.58
per cent. a year; and the gross receipts of the company increased on an
average by 13.61 per cent. a year.</p>

<p>In the period 1855 to 1866, the messages carried annually by the
British and Irish Magnetic Company grew from 264,727 to 1,520,640, an
average annual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
growth of 17.58 per cent. At the same time the average receipts per
message fell from $0.96 in 1855, to $0.48 in 1866.</p>

<p>In the period from 1855 to 1866, the number of messages carried
annually by all of the telegraph companies of the United Kingdom
increased from 1,017,529, to 5,781,989, an average annual increase of
16.36 per cent.</p>

<p>In the same period, from 1855 to 1866, the telegrams sent in
Switzerland increased on an average by 13.14 per cent. each year; those
sent in Belgium increased on an average by 31.45 per cent.; and those
sent in France increased on an average by 25.40 per cent. When one
takes into consideration that in Belgium, in 1867, only 38 per cent.
of the messages transmitted related to stock exchange and commercial
business, and that in France in the same year only 48 per cent. of the
messages sent related to industrial, commercial, and stock exchange
transactions, there is nothing in the comparison between the rate of
growth in the United Kingdom on the one hand, and in the countries
of Continental Europe on the other hand, to indicate that the use of
the telegraphs for the purposes of trade and industry was held back
in the United Kingdom by excessive charges or by lack of telegraphic
facilities. So far as the United Kingdom lagged behind, it did so
because the public had not learned to use the telegraphs freely for the
transmission of personal and family news. And when, in 1875, under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
State owned telegraphs, the public of the United Kingdom had learned
to use the telegraphs as freely as the public of Continental Europe
used them, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, the eminent British political
economist, in the course of a review of the price paid for this
free use of the telegraphs, said: &ldquo;A large part of the
increased traffic on the Government wires consists of complimentary
messages, or other trifling matters, which we can have no sufficient
motive for promoting. Men have been known to telegraph for a clean
pocket handkerchief&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Jevons, in 1866 to 1869,
had been an ardent advocate of nationalizing the telegraphs.<a
href="#Footnote_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Scudamore in 1866 to 1869 caused many people to believe that the
United Kingdom was woefully behind the continental countries in the
use of the telegraphs. He did so by publishing a table which showed
that in 1866 there had been sent: in Belgium, 1 telegram to every 37
letters carried by the Post Office; in Switzerland, 1 telegram to every
69 letters; and in the United Kingdom, 1 telegram to every 121 letters.
That table, however, really proved nothing; for in 1866, there were
carried: in Belgium, 5 letters for every inhabitant; in Switzerland,
10 letters; and in the United Kingdom, 25 letters. Had the people of
Belgium and Switzerland written as many letters proportionately as the
people of the United Kingdom, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
table prepared by Mr. Scudamore would have read: Belgium, 1 telegram
for every 185 letters; Switzerland, 1 telegram for every 172 letters;
and the United Kingdom, 1 telegram for every 121 letters.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore could, however, have prepared a table showing that
the people of Switzerland and Belgium used the telegraph more freely
than did the people of the United Kingdom, but not so much more
freely as to call for so drastic a remedy in the United Kingdom as
the nationalization of the telegraphs. The table in question would
have shown that in 1866, there was transmitted: in Switzerland, 1
telegram to every 3.75 inhabitants; in Belgium, 1 telegram to every
4.25 inhabitants; and in the United Kingdom, 1 telegram to every 5.3
inhabitants. The table in question would also have indicated the
necessity of care in the use of the several kinds of statistics just
put before the reader. The table placed Switzerland in advance of
Belgium, while the other sets of statistics had placed Belgium in
advance of Switzerland.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Alleged Wastefulness of Competition</em></div>

<p>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s concluding argument was that little or no
relief from the evils from which the public was suffering could be
expected &ldquo;so long as the working of the telegraphs was conducted
by commercial companies striving chiefly to earn a dividend, and
engaged in wasteful competition.&rdquo; In support of the charge of
wasteful competition he stated &ldquo;that many large districts are
provided with duplicate and triplicate lines,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
worked by different companies, but taking much the same course and
serving precisely the same places; and that these duplicate or
triplicate lines and duplicate or triplicate offices only divide
the business without materially increasing the accommodation of the
districts or towns which they serve.&rdquo; But when Mr. Scudamore
sought to substantiate this charge of waste arising out of competition,
he could do no more than state that not less than 2,000 miles of line
in a total of 16,066 miles were redundant, and that perhaps 300 to 350
offices in a total of 2,040 offices were redundant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The evidence presented by Mr. Scudamore failed to reveal a
situation that called for so drastic a remedy as the nationalization
of the telegraphs. It revealed no evils or shortcomings that it was
unreasonable to expect would be sufficiently mitigated, if not entirely
removed, by the measures proposed by the telegraph companies.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Grimston, Chairman of the Electric and International
Telegraph Company, stated that the telegraph companies long since would
have asked Parliament to permit them to consolidate, had there been
the least likelihood of Parliament granting the request. Consolidation
would have made the resulting amalgamated company so strong that the
company would have been justified in adopting a bolder policy in the
matter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of extending the telegraph lines to places remote from the railways. No
single company could afford to assume too large a burden of lines that
would begin as &ldquo;suckers&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;feeders.&rdquo;
A company with a large burden of that kind would be in a precarious
position, because any of the other existing companies, or some new
company, might take advantage of the situation and cut heavily
into that part of the company&rsquo;s business that was carried on
between the large cities and was bearing the burden of the non-paying
extensions. But if the existing companies were to consolidate, the
resulting company would become so strong that it need not fear such
competition from any company newly to be organized. That there was
much strength in that argument appears from the fact that, in 1869,
Mr. Scudamore as well as the Government adopted it in support of
the request that the State be given the monopoly of the business of
transmitting messages by electricity. Mr. Scudamore argued that since
the State was going to assume the burden of building and operating a
large number of unprofitable, or relatively unprofitable, extensions,
it should not be exposed to the possibility of competition from
companies organized for the purpose of tapping the profitable traffic
between the large cities, &ldquo;the very cream of the business.&rdquo;
Mr. Scudamore added that he had been told that a company was on the
verge of being organized for the purpose of competing for the business
between the large towns as soon as the properties of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
existing companies should have been transferred to the State.<a
href="#Footnote_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Companies&rsquo; Proposal</em></div>

<p>The telegraph companies proposed to give the public substantial
safeguards against the possibility of being exploited by the proposed
amalgamated company. They proposed that Parliament should fix maximum
charges for the transmission of messages, in conjunction with a limit
on dividends that might be exceeded only on condition that the existing
charges on messages be reduced by a stated amount every time that
the dividend be raised a stated amount beyond the limit fixed. The
companies proposed also that shares to be issued in the future should
be sold at public auction, and that any premiums realized from such
sales should be invested in the plant with the condition that they
should not be entitled to any dividend. Provisions such as these,
at the time, were in force in the case of certain gas companies and
water companies. They have for years past been incorporated in all
gas company charters; and they have worked well. There was no reason,
in 1866 to 1869, why the proposals of the telegraph companies should
not be accepted; that is, no reason from the view-point of the man
who hesitated to exchange the evils and shortcomings incident to
private ownership for the evils and shortcomings incident to public
ownership.</p>

   CHAPTER IV <br /><span class="smcap">The Purchase of the Telegraphs</span>
</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Upon inadequate consideration the Disraeli Ministry
   estimated at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 the cost of
   nationalization. Political expediency responsible for
   Government&rsquo;s inadequate investigation. The Government raises
   its estimate to $30,000,000; adding that it could afford
   to pay $40,000,000 to $50,000,000. Mr. Goschen, M. P., and
   Mr. Leeman, M. P., warn the House of Commons against the
   Government&rsquo;s estimates, which had been prepared by Mr.
   Scudamore. The Gladstone Ministry, relying on Mr. Scudamore,
   estimates at $3,500,000 the &ldquo;reversionary rights&rdquo; of the
   railway companies, for which rights the State ultimately paid
   $10,000,000 to $11,000,000.</p>
</div>

<p>On April 1, 1868, the Disraeli Government brought into Parliament
a &ldquo;Bill to enable the Postmaster General to acquire, work,
and maintain Electric Telegraphs in the United Kingdom.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> At
this time the Government still was ignorant of the precise relations
existing between the telegraph companies and the railways; and it did
not foresee that the purchase of the assets of the telegraph companies
would lead to the purchase of the reversionary rights of the railways
in the telegraphs, the telegraphs having been, for the most part,
erected on the lands of the railways, under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
leases of way-leaves that still had to run, on an average, 23.7 years.
At this time, therefore, the Government contemplated only the purchase
of the Electric and International Company, the British and Irish
Company, the United Kingdom Company, and the London and Provincial, the
successor of the London District Telegraph Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Purchase Price estimated at $15,000,000 to $20,000,000</em>
</div>

<p>In the course of the debate upon the order for the Second Reading
of the Bill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, said
that &ldquo;if the House would excuse him, he would rather not enter
fully into details with respect to the purchase at present. But
he would say that, speaking roughly, it would take something near
$20,000,000, or, at all events, between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000
for the purchase and the necessary extensions of the lines.&rdquo; He
added that if the purchase should be made, the telegraphs would yield
a net revenue of $1,050,000 a year; and that sum would suffice to pay
the interest on the debt to be contracted, and to clear off that debt
in twenty-nine years.<a href="#Footnote_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"
class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Parliament was to be prorogued in August; and a General Election was
to follow prorogation. The Government naturally was anxious to avoid
having to go into the General Election without having achieved the
nationalization of the telegraphs; particularly, since the opposition
party also had committed itself to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
State purchase. Then again, the Government believed that the value of
the telegraphs was increasing so rapidly that the State would lose
money by any postponement of the act of purchase. For these reasons the
Government entered into negotiations with the various interests that
evinced a disposition to oppose in Parliament the Government&rsquo;s
Bill, until finally all opposition was removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Politics forces Government&rsquo;s Hand</em>
</div>

<p>The Bill, as introduced, proposed that the State pay the four
telegraph companies enumerated, the money actually invested by
them&mdash;about $11,500,000&mdash;together with an allowance for
the prospective increase of the earnings of the companies, and an
additional allowance for compulsory sale. The last two items were
to be fixed by an arbitrator who was to be appointed by the Board
of Trade. The companies flatly rejected this offer, pointing, by
way of precedent, to the Act of 1844, which fixed the terms to be
given to the railways, should the State at any time resolve upon the
compulsory purchase of the railways. The Act in question prescribed:
&ldquo;twenty-five years&rsquo; purchase of the average annual divisible
profits for three years before such purchase, provided these profits
shall equal or exceed 10 per cent. on the capital; and, if not, the
railway company shall be at liberty to claim any further sum for
anticipated profits, to be fixed by arbitration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Government next offered the companies the highest market price
reached by the stock of the companies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
on the London Stock Exchange up to May 28, 1868, plus an allowance
for prospective profits, to be fixed by arbitration. The companies
rejected that offer, but accepted the next one, namely, twenty
years&rsquo; purchase of the profits of the year that was to end
with June 30, 1868.<a href="#Footnote_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"
class="fnanchor">31</a> Mr. W. H. Smith, one of the most highly
esteemed Members of the House of Commons, who was himself a director
in the Electric and International, subsequently spoke as follows of
these negotiations: &ldquo;In 1868 the telegraph companies were by no
means desirous to part with their property, but the question whether
the Government should be in possession of the telegraphs having been
forced on their consideration, the three principal companies very
reluctantly came to an arrangement with the Government of the day.
He did not wish to express any opinion on the bargain which had been
made, and would only say for himself and those with whom he was
associated, that they very deeply regretted to be obliged to part with
property which had been profitable, and which they had great pleasure
in managing.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"
class="fnanchor">32</a> Mr. Smith added that the net earnings of the
Electric and International had increased from $336,815 in 1862, to
$859,215 in 1868; and that the average annual increase per cent. had
been 17.2 per cent.</p>

<p>The state of the public mind at the time when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Government introduced its Bill, was indicated in the issue of
April 11, 1868, of <cite>The Economist</cite>, the leading
financial newspaper of Great Britain. Said the journal in question:
&ldquo;Even if the companies resist, they will not be very powerful
opponents&mdash;firstly, because the leaders of both parties have
already sanctioned the scheme; and, secondly, because the companies
are exceptionally unpopular. There is, probably, no interest in the
Kingdom which is so cordially disliked by the press, which, when
united, is stronger than any interest, and which has suffered for years
under the shortcomings of the private companies. The real discussion
in Parliament, should there be any, will turn upon a very different
point, and it will be not a little interesting to observe how far the
current of opinion on the subject of State interference with private
enterprise, has really ebbed within the last few years. Twelve or
fourteen years ago it would have been useless for any Chancellor of
the Exchequer to propose such an operation&hellip;. It was [at that
time] believed on all sides that State interference was wrong, because
it shut out the private speculators from the natural reward of their
energy and labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the Select Committee of the House of Commons to which was
referred the Government&rsquo;s Bill, Mr. Scudamore argued that if
Parliament could not make a reasonable bargain with the telegraph
companies, it could authorize the Post Office to build a system of
telegraphs. But that measure ought to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
adopted only as a last resource. It was of paramount importance to
avoid shaking the confidence of the investors that private enterprise
would be allowed to reap the full benefits of its enterprise, and that
it would be exposed to nothing more than the ordinary vicissitudes of
trade. That the possibility of competition by the State, by means of
money taken from the people by taxation, never had been included within
the ordinary vicissitudes of trade. Coming to the question of paying
twenty years&rsquo; purchase of the profits of the year 1867-1868, Mr.
Scudamore said: &ldquo;The telegraphs are so much more valuable a
property than we originally believed, that if you do not buy them this
year, you unquestionably will have to pay $2,500,000 more for them next
year&hellip;. Their [average] annual growth of profit is certainly not
less than ten per cent. at present. If you wait till next year and
only give them nineteen years&rsquo; purchase, you will give them more
than you will now give. If you wait two years, and give them eighteen
years&rsquo; purchase, you will still give them more than you will now
give, assuming the annual growth of profit to be the same. If you wait
four years, and give them sixteen years&rsquo; purchase, you will again
give them more, and in addition you will have lost the benefit accruing
in the four years, which would have gone into their pockets instead of
coming into the pockets of the nation.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_33_33"
id="FNanchor_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Purchase price estimated at $30,000,000</em>
</div>

<p>In the House of Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W.
Hunt, said: &ldquo;The terms agreed upon, although very liberal, were
not more liberal than they should be under the circumstances, and did
not offer more than an arbitrator would have given. The companies had
agreed to sell at twenty years&rsquo; purchase of present net profits,
although those profits were increasing at the rate of 10 per cent.
a year. He was satisfied the more the House looked into the matter,
the more they would be satisfied with the bargain made.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer continued with the statement that Mr.
Scudamore estimated that the Postmaster General would obtain from the
telegraphs a net revenue of $1,015,000 at the minimum, and $1,790,000
at the maximum. The mean of those estimates was $1,402,500, which sum
would pay the interest and sinking fund payments&mdash;3.5 per cent. in
all&mdash;on $40,000,000. The Government, therefore, could afford to
pay $40,000,000 for the telegraphs. Indeed, on the basis of the maximum
estimate of net revenue, it could pay $50,000,000. But Mr. Scudamore
confidently fixed at $30,000,000 at the maximum, the price that the
Government would have to pay. Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s estimates of net
revenue &ldquo;would stand any amount of examination by the House, as
they had stood very careful scrutiny by the Select Committee,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and for the Government to carry out the scheme would not only prove
safe but profitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the Government had learned that it would be necessary
to purchase the reversionary rights of the railway companies in the
business of the telegraph companies. The Government had agreed with
the railway companies upon the terms under which it was to be left to
arbitration how much should be paid for those reversionary rights. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he was unwilling to divulge the
Government&rsquo;s estimates of what sums would be awarded under the
arbitration; for, if he did divulge them, they might be used against
the Government before the arbitrators. &ldquo;But Mr. Scudamore, whose
ability with regard not only to this matter, but also to other matters,
had been of great service to the Government, had given considerable
attention to the matter, and Mr. Scudamore believed that $30,000,000
would be the outside figure&rdquo; to be paid to the telegraph
companies and the railway companies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
added that Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s &ldquo;calculations had been submitted
to and approved by Mr. Foster, the principal finance officer of the
Treasury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In passing, it may be stated that Mr. Foster had stated before
the Select Committee of the House of Commons that he had given only
&ldquo;two or three days&rdquo; to the consideration of the extremely
difficult question of the value that the arbitrators would be likely
to put upon the railway companies&rsquo; reversionary rights.<a

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Parliament warned against Government&rsquo;s Estimates</em>
</div>

<p>Mr. Goschen, of the banking firm of Fr&uuml;hling and Goschen, who
had been a member of the Select Committee, and had taken an active part
in its proceedings, replied that &ldquo;the inquiry [by the committee]
had been carried on under great disadvantages. An opposition, organized
by private interests [the telegraph companies and the railway
companies], had been changed into an organization of warm supporters
of the Bill pending the inquiry. Before the Committee there appeared
Counsel representing the promoters [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>,
the Government], and, at first, counsel representing the original
opposition to the Bill [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span> the telegraph
and railway companies]; but in consequence of the change in the views
of the opposition, who during the proceedings became friendly to the
Bill, there was no counsel present to cross-examine the witnesses.
Consequently, in the interests of the public, and in order that all the
facts might be brought to light, members of the committee [chiefly Mr.
Goschen and Mr. Leeman] had to discharge the duty of cross-examining
the witnesses. The same causes led to the result that the witnesses
produced were all on one side&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_36_36"
id="FNanchor_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Goschen emphasized the fact that upon the expiring of the
telegraph companies&rsquo; leases of rights of way over the railways,
the reversionary rights of the railways would come into play, and that
the Government, after having paid twenty years&rsquo; purchase to the
telegraph companies, &ldquo;would probably have to pay half as much
again to the railways.&rdquo; &ldquo;The railways had felt the strength
of their position so much, that they had pointed out to the committee
that they would not only be entitled to an increase in the rate which
they now received [as rent from the telegraph companies] as soon as the
leases expired, but they would also be entitled to an indemnification
[from the State] for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the loss they would sustain in not being allowed [in consequence of the
nationalization of the telegraphs] to put the screw on the telegraph
companies.&rdquo; Mr. Goschen said &ldquo;he felt very strongly on
this point because he was convinced that it was impossible to find an
instance of any private enterprise which, while it returned a profit
of 15 per cent. to its shareholders, enjoyed a monopoly for any great
length of time.&rdquo; If the Government purchased the assets of the
telegraph companies, the railway companies would succeed in compelling
the State to share with them the great profits to be obtained from the
business of telegraphy. They would do so by compelling the Government
to pay a big sum for their reversionary rights in the telegraph
companies, as the price for abstaining from building up a telegraph
business of their own, upon the expiry of the telegraph companies&rsquo;
leases. No business that yielded a return of 15 per cent. could be
worth twenty years&rsquo; purchase, for such returns were very insecure,
because of the certainty that competition would arise from persons who
would be content with ten per cent., or less.<a href="#Footnote_37_37"
id="FNanchor_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Mr. Leeman, who had sat on the Select Committee, and had, with Mr.
Goschen, done all of the cross-examining directed to bring out the
points that told against the Government&rsquo;s proposal, followed Mr.
Goschen in the debate. He began by stating that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
spoke with &ldquo;twenty years&rsquo; experience as a railway
man;&rdquo; and he directed his argument especially against the
terms of the agreements made by the Government to purchase the
reversionary rights of the railways in the telegraph companies&rsquo;
businesses. &ldquo;Mr. Scudamore, who was what he had already been
described to be&mdash;a most able man&mdash;had not known, up to
the time of the second reading of the Bill [June 8, 1868], what
were the existing arrangements between the telegraph companies
and the railway companies; and, subsequently, while still without
the requisite knowledge on that point,<a href="#Footnote_38_38"
id="FNanchor_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> he went and agreed on the
part of the Government to buy the interest of the telegraph companies
at 20 years&rsquo; purchase of their profits. In addition it was to be
remembered that the railway companies had reversionary interests which
would come into operation after comparatively short time for which
their arrangements with the telegraph companies were to continue. In
July, 1866, Mr. Scudamore estimated the necessary outlay on the part of
the Government at $12,000,000. In February, 1868, another officer of
the Government raised the estimate to $15,000,000; but it was not until
the Bill came before the committee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
[July, 1868], that Mr. Scudamore said that $30,000,000 would be
required&hellip;. He [Mr. Leeman] undertook to say that Mr. Scudamore
was as wide of the mark in his estimate of $30,000,000, as he had been
in his estimate of $12,000,000. At the expiration of their agreements
with the telegraph companies, several [all] of the railway companies
would have it in their power to compete with the Post Office in the
transmission of telegraphic messages. No doubt this fact would be
brought under the notice of the arbitrators when the value of their
reversion was being considered, and at what price would the arbitrators
value this reversionary power of competition? Had Mr. Scudamore made
any estimate on the subject? Owing to the position in which Mr.
Scudamore had placed the Government, the railway companies had demanded
and had been promised terms in respect of their reversions, which he,
as a railway man, now said it was the duty of any Government to have
resisted&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Railway Companies&rsquo; Reversionary Rights</em>
</div>

<p>For the better understanding of this question of reversions, it must
be stated that the telegraph companies, for the most part, had erected
their poles and wires on the permanent way of the railway companies,
under leases of way-leaves, which, in 1868, still had 23.7 years to
run, on the average.<a href="#Footnote_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"
class="fnanchor">40</a> As the leases should expire, the railway
companies would have an opportunity to try to obtain better terms, or
to order
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the companies to remove their plant, and then to erect their own plant,
and themselves engage in the telegraph business. But the railway
companies were handicapped by the fact that the leases did not expire
together, and that it would be difficult to build up a new telegraph
system piecemeal out of the parts of line that would become free in the
next three years to twenty-nine years. There was, therefore, much room
for difference of opinion on the question how far the railway companies
would be able &ldquo;to put the screw&rdquo; on the telegraph companies
upon the successive expirations of leases. The Stock Exchange doubtless
took the contingency into consideration, that being one reason why
the Electric and International shares did not rise above fourteen
years&rsquo; purchase of the annual dividends. Mr. Scudamore, before
the Select Committee, expressed the opinion that the railway companies
could force the telegraph companies &ldquo;to give them somewhat better
terms; that would be the extreme result of any negotiations between the
telegraph companies and the railway companies.&rdquo; To Mr. Foster,
principal officer of the Finance Division of the Treasury, whom the
Government called to support Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s evidence, Mr. Leeman
put the question: &ldquo;Looking at it as a financial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
question, do you suppose all the railways in the country, having
power to work their telegraphs at the end of ten years, but for this
Bill, will not put in a claim for a very large sum in respect of that
reversion?&rdquo; The witness replied: &ldquo;I do not think it would
be of very great value in the first place, and in the next place it
would be a value deferred for ten years, which would very much diminish
it.&rdquo; To the further query: &ldquo;You do not take the view that
we shall have to pay the railway companies and also the telegraph
companies for the same thing,&rdquo; he replied in the negative.<a
href="#Footnote_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the Government&rsquo;s Bill had been referred to
the Select Committee, the Government made the railway companies
this proposition, which was accepted. The Government was to acquire
perpetual and exclusive way-leaves for telegraph lines over the
railways, and the price to be paid therefor was to be left to
arbitration. The railway companies were to have the choice of
presenting their claims either under the head of payment for the
cession of perpetual and exclusive way-leaves to the Government;
or, under the head of compensation for the loss of right to grant
way-leaves to any one other than the Government, as well as for the
loss of right themselves to transmit messages, except on their own
railway business. The Government was of the opinion that the sums to be
paid to the railways under this agreement would not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
be large enough to raise above $30,000,000, the total sum to be paid to
the telegraph companies and the railways.</p>

<p>Parliament enacted the Bill of 1868 authorizing the Government to
purchase the property of the telegraph companies and the rights of the
railways; but it provided that the resulting Act of 1868 should not
take effect, unless, in the Session of 1869, Parliament should put at
the disposal of the Postmaster General such monies as were required to
carry out the provisions of the Act of 1868.</p>

<p>The Government immediately appointed a committee to ascertain the
profits earned by the telegraph companies in the year that had ended
with June, 1868. The committee, which consisted of the Receiver and
Accountant General of the Post Office, and other gentlemen selected
from the Post Office for their general ability, but especially for
their knowledge of accounts, in June and July, 1869, reported that
the aggregate of the sums to be paid to the six telegraph companies
was $28,575,235,<a href="#Footnote_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"
class="fnanchor">42</a> the companies having put in claims aggregating
$35,180,185.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>While the Bill had been before the Select Committee, the Government
had agreed to purchase the properties of Reuters Telegram Company
(Norderney Cable), as well as of the Universal Private Company. The
price paid for those properties absorbed the margin on which Mr.
Scudamore and the Government had counted for the purchase of the
reversionary rights of the railways.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Disraeli Ministry, which had carried the
measure of 1868, had been replaced, on December 9, 1868, by the
Gladstone Ministry. On July 5, 1869, the Marquis of Hartington,
Postmaster General, laid before Parliament a Bill authorizing the Post
Office Department to spend $35,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out
the act of 1868. The Marquis of Hartington said that $28,575,000 would
be required for the purchase of the assets of the telegraph companies;
that $3,500,000 would cover the claims of the railways, which had not
yet been adjusted; and that $1,500,000 would suffice to rearrange the
telegraph lines and to make such extensions as would be required to
give Government telegraph offices to 3,776 places, towns, and cities,
the present number of places having telegraph offices being 1,882.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Hartington stated that Parliament &ldquo;was quite
competent to repudiate the bargain of 1868, if they thought it a bad
one&hellip;. Having given the subject his best consideration, he must
say, without expressing any opinion as to the terms of the bargain,
that if they were to begin afresh, he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
think they could get the property on better terms.&rdquo; He added that
the &ldquo;Government would take over the telegraphs of the companies
on January 1, 1870, on the basis of paying twenty times the profits
of the year 1867-68. But that in consequence of the increase of the
business since 1867-68, the $28,575,000 which the State would pay the
telegraph companies, would represent, not twenty years&rsquo; purchase
of the profits in 1870, but considerably under seventeen years&rsquo;
purchase of those profits. The trade of the Electric and International
had been found to be growing at the rate of 18 per cent. a year;
that of the British and Irish at the rate of 32 per cent.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Robert Lowe, was by no means
so sanguine. He spoke of the &ldquo;immense price&rdquo; which the
Government was asked to pay, &ldquo;a price of which he, at all events,
washed his hands altogether. The Right Honorable Gentlemen opposite
[Mr. Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1868], had accused them of
appropriating the honor of this measure. He had not the slightest
desire to contest the point with the Right Honorable Gentleman, who
was welcome to it all. The matter was found by the present Government
in so complicated a state that it was impossible for them to recede;
but unless the House was prepared to grant that [<span lang="la"
xml:lang="la">i. e.</span> a government monopoly] without which they
believed it would be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
impossible to carry on the business effectively, it would be
better that they should reject the Bill altogether.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Mr. Torrens moved an amendment adverse to the Bill, but his motion
was defeated by a vote of 148 to 23. Before the vote was taken, Mr.
W. Fowler, of the firm of Alexander &amp; Company, Lombard Street,
speaking of the reversionary rights of the railway companies, had
said: &ldquo;Therefore, for what the House knew, there might be
contingent liabilities for hundreds of thousands or millions of pounds
sterling more.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"
class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>The measure became a law in August, 1869; and on February 5, 1870,
the telegraphs of the United Kingdom were transferred to the Post
Office Department. In the course of the year 1870, the Government
bought the properties of the Jersey and Guernsey Company and of the
Isle of Man Company. Those purchases, together with a large number of
minor purchases made in 1869, but not previously mentioned, raised the
total sum paid to the telegraph companies to $29,236,735.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>Reversionary Rights estimated at $3,500,000
cost $10,000,000</em></div>

<p>Not until 1879 were the last of the claims of the railway companies
adjusted. The writer has not succeeded in finding a specific official
statement of the aggregate sum paid to the railway companies for their
reversionary rights and for the grant to the Post Office of perpetual
and exclusive way-leaves over their properties, but he infers that
that sum was $10,000,000 or $11,000,000. That inference is based on
testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
given in 1888 by Mr. C. H. B. Patey,<a href="#Footnote_46_47"
id="FNanchor_46_47" class="fnanchor">46</a> Third Secretary to the Post
Office, and on information given by the Postmaster General in 1895.<a
href="#Footnote_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48" class="fnanchor">47</a> It
will be recalled, that in 1869, the Marquis of Hartington, Postmaster
General, had told the House of Commons that the payments for the
rights in question would not exceed $3,500,000. The Postmaster General
doubtless spoke on the strength of assurances given by Mr. Scudamore.
It will be remembered also that Mr. Leeman, in 1868, had warned the
House in strong terms that Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s estimates were not to
be trusted. Finally, it will be remembered that in 1869, Mr. W. Fowler,
a financier of high standing, had warned the House of Commons that
&ldquo;there might be contingent liabilities of thousands or millions
of pounds sterling more.&rdquo;</p>

     <p>Mr. Leeman cross-questions Mr. Scudamore.</p>

      <p>2,331. &ldquo;Did you agree with the Telegraph
      Companies till after this Bill was sent to the Select
      Committee?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>2,332. &ldquo;At the time this Bill was sent to this
      Committee you had petitions against you, had you not, from
      25 or 30 different interests?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; quite
      that.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,333. &ldquo;Since that time, have you, with the
      exception of the interest which Mr. Merewether now represents
      [Universal Private Telegraph Co.], bought up every interest,
      or contracted to buy up every interest, which was represented
      by those petitioners?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, subject to
      arbitration and the approval of the committee.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,334. &ldquo;They had largely, upon the face of their
      petitions, controverted the views you have been expressing to
      this Committee?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They had endeavored to do
      so.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,335. &ldquo;They had in fact?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
      had endeavored to put forward a case against me. I do not say
      it was a good case.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,336. &ldquo;In direct opposition to the
      information you have been supplying to the
      Committee?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,337. &ldquo;The Electric and International Telegraph
      Company was the company most largely interested, was it
      not?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,338. &ldquo;That company had put forth its
      views controverting in detail what you have been
      stating to the Committee in the course of your
      examination?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Attempting to controvert
      it.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,339. &ldquo;By your arrangements, since the time at
      which this Bill was submitted to this Select Committee to
      inquire into, you have in truth shut the mouths of all these
      parties?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They are perfectly welcome to
      speak; I am not shutting their mouths.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,340. &ldquo;Do you propose to call
      them?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, but they are here to be
      called.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>2,341. &ldquo;You do not propose to call them. This is
      the fact, is it not, that this Bill was sent to the Select
      Committee, with special instructions to make inquiries into
      various matters raised by petitions from 25 to 30 different
      interests, and you have, since that time, subsidized every
      interest that could give any information to this Committee; is
      not that the fact?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The completion of the telegraph system cost $8,500,000;
   Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s successive estimates had been respectively
   $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s brilliant forecast
   of the increase of traffic under public ownership. Mr.
   Scudamore&rsquo;s appalling blunder in predicting that the State
   telegraphs would be self-supporting. Operating expenses on the
   average exceed 92.5% of the gross earnings, in contrast to
   Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s estimate of 51% to 56%. The annual telegraph
   deficits aggregate 26.5% of the capital invested in the plant.

   <em>Estimated Expenditure</em> versus <em>Actual Expenditure</em>
</div>

<p>As soon as the telegraphs had been transferred to the Government,
the Post Office Department set to work to rearrange the wires wherever
competition had caused duplication or triplication; to extend the
wires into the centre of each town or place &ldquo;imperfectly&rdquo; served; to
build lines to all places with money order issuing Post Offices that
had no telegraphic service; to enlarge the local telegraph system of
Metropolitan London from 95 telegraph offices in 1869, to 334 offices
at the close of 1870; to give cities like Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Glasgow and Manchester, from 14 to 32 telegraph offices each;<a
href="#Footnote_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49" class="fnanchor">48</a> to
provide additional wires to meet the anticipated growth of traffic;
and to release some 5,000 or 6,000 miles of wire for the exclusive
use of the railway companies in the conduct of transportation. For
these several purposes the Post Office Department, in the course of
the three years ending with September, 1873, erected 8,000 miles of
posts, and 46,000 miles of wire; strengthened 8,500 miles of line;
laid 192 miles of underground pipes and 23 miles of pneumatic pipes;
and laid 248 miles of submarine cable. By September, 1873, the Post
Office Department had spent upon the rearrangement and extension of
the telegraphs, the sum of $11,041,000.<a href="#Footnote_49_50"
id="FNanchor_49_50" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Something over $2,500,000<a href="#Footnote_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"
class="fnanchor">50</a> of that sum represented the cost of repairing
the depreciation suffered by the plant in the years 1868 and 1869,
a depreciation for which full allowance had been made in fixing the
purchase price. The balance, $8,500,000, represented new capital
outlay.</p>

<p>In 1868 Mr. Scudamore had stated before the Select Committee of
the House of Commons that it would cost $1,000,000 to rearrange the
telegraphs and give perfect telegraphic service to 2,950 places.<a
href="#Footnote_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52" class="fnanchor">51</a> In
1869, the Postmaster General, the Marquis of Hartington, had told the
House of Commons that $1,500,000 would cover the cost of rearranging
the telegraphs and giving perfect accommodation to 3,776 places.<a
href="#Footnote_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53" class="fnanchor">52</a>
In April, 1867, on the other hand, Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, an eminent
economist, had estimated at $12,500,000 the cost of &ldquo;the
improvement of the present telegraphs, and their extension to many
villages which do not at present possess a telegraph station.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s estimate of the cost of extending the
telegraphs to 841 places that had no telegraphic accommodation, was
based on the assumption that each such extension would require, on the
average, the erection of three-quarters of a mile of telegraph line.
But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
when the Post Office Department came to build to &ldquo;new&rdquo;
places, it found that &ldquo;the opening of upward of 1,000
additional telegraph offices necessitated the erection of not less
than 3,000 miles of telegraph line.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_54_55"
id="FNanchor_54_55" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>The results have shown that Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s other estimates
of the cost of rearranging and extending the telegraphs, presented
by himself in 1868, and by the Postmaster General, the Marquis
of Hartington, in 1869, were equally wide of the mark. Numerous
<cite>Committees on the Public Accounts</cite> sitting in the years
1871 to 1876, together with the <cite>Committee on Post Office
Telegraph Department</cite>, 1876, attempted to inquire into the
enormous discrepancy between the estimated cost and the actual cost of
rearranging and extending the telegraphs. But none of those attempts
were rewarded with any success whatever.<a href="#Footnote_55_56"
id="FNanchor_55_56" class="fnanchor">55</a> The representatives of
the Post Office and of the Treasury always attributed the discrepancy
&ldquo;to the purchase of undertakings which were not contemplated
at the time when the original measures were submitted to the House,
and to unforeseen expenses for extensions.&rdquo; But the State, as
a matter of fact, made no purchases beyond those contemplated in
1869&mdash;excepting the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
purchase of the Jersey and Guernsey cable for $286,750, and the
purchase of the Isle of Man cable for $80,680. As for unforeseen
extensions, in 1869, the Marquis of Hartington had counted on carrying
the telegraphs to 3,776 places, and in 1878 there were but 3,761 postal
telegraph offices, counting the 300 offices in London, and the numerous
offices in the several large principal cities.<a href="#Footnote_56_57"
id="FNanchor_56_57" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Scudamore, aided by the state of public opinion created by the
agitation of the British Chambers of Commerce under the leadership
of the Chamber of Commerce of Edinburgh, carried away the Disraeli
Ministry and the Gladstone Ministry. Even more powerful than Mr.
Scudamore&rsquo;s argument from the extensive use made of the telegraphs
on the Continent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Europe, was Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s promise that the State telegraphs
should begin by paying a profit sufficient to cover the interest on
$30,000,000 at the lowest estimate, and $50,000,000 at the highest
estimate; and that the profit should increase with the advancing
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Penny Postage Precedent</em></div>

<p>Before examining the evidence upon which Mr. Scudamore predicted
such large profits, it will be well to consider briefly the nature
of the evidence afforded to Mr. Scudamore by Sir Rowland Hill&rsquo;s
epoch-making &ldquo;invention of penny postage.&rdquo; This is the
more necessary, since Mr. Scudamore himself cited the success of penny
postage in support of his proposal for a uniform rate of 24 cents for
telegraph messages. Upon the introduction of the penny postage, the
letters carried by the Post Office of the United Kingdom jumped from
76,000,000 in 1839 to 169,000,000 in 1840, and to 271,000,000 in 1845.
But the net revenue obtained by the Post Office Department from the
carriage of letters fell from $8,170,000 in 1839 to $2,505,000 in 1840.
Though the net revenue increased each year beginning with 1841, not
until 1863 did it again reach the point at which it had been in 1839.
In 1863, the number of letters carried was 642,000,000&mdash;almost
four times the number carried in 1840, and eight times the number
carried in 1839.<a href="#Footnote_57_63" id="FNanchor_57_63"
class="fnanchor">57</a> In short, the evidence from the penny postage
was, that care must be used in arguing from an increase of business to
an increase of net revenue; and that the prospect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of a great increase in business did not necessarily justify the
incurrence of indefinitely large charges on account of interest on
capital invested.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s Revenue
Forecasts</em></div>

<p> Mr. Scudamore began by assuming that the Post Office would take
charge of the telegraphs on July 1, 1869; and that by that time the
telegraph companies would have developed a business of 7,500,000
messages a year. On the basis of the traffic of 1866, and under the
companies&rsquo; charges, 55 per cent. of the business would consist of
messages carried 100 miles or less, which would be charged 24 cents
each; 30 per cent. would be messages carried from 100 to 200 miles,
being charged 36 cents each; 10 per cent. would be messages carried
beyond 200 miles, which would be charged 48 cents; and, finally, 5 per
cent. would consist of messages to and from Ireland, which would be
charged from 72 cents to 96 cents. The adoption of the uniform rate of
24 cents, irrespective of distance, would reduce by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
33 per cent. the charge on the messages sent from 100 to 200 miles, and
would increase those messages by 90 per cent.; it would reduce by 50
per cent. the charge on the messages carried more than 200 miles, and
would increase those messages by 90 per cent.; and, finally, it would
increase by 150 per cent. the number of messages between Great Britain
and Ireland. The introduction of the uniform 24 cent rate, therefore,
would increase the total number of messages from 7,500,000 to
10,612,500. That last number would be further increased by 10 per cent.
in consequence of the general increase of facilities, and a material
reduction in the charges made for the delivery of messages to points
outside of the free delivery areas. Thus the total number of messages
that the Post Office telegraphs would carry in the first year would be
11,673,000, or, say, in round numbers, 11,650,000.</p>

<p>Since the average message would be somewhat over 20 words in length,
one might count on average receipts per message of 28 cents; so that
the 11,650,000 messages in question would bring the Post Office a gross
revenue of $3,400,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore next proceeded to estimate what it would cost to
earn the $3,400,000 just mentioned. He began with the total working
expenses, in 1866, of the four leading companies, namely $1,650,000. He
stated that the companies had said that if permitted to consolidate,
they could reduce expenses by $275,000 a year. But if the Post Office
were to take over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
telegraphs, it would reduce the expenses by more than the last
mentioned sum, for it could use the existing Post Office buildings,
the existing staff, and so forth. Deducting numerous other items
representing expenses that the companies had incurred on account of
the operation of foreign cables and the conduct of other forms of
business that the Post Office would discontinue, Mr. Scudamore reached
the conclusion that the Post Office, in 1866, could have operated at a
total cost of $1,325,000 the plants of the four telegraph companies.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore added 10 per cent. to the last mentioned sum, in order
to cover the cost of maintaining and operating the extensions that
the State proposed to make at a cost of $1,000,000. He took 10 per
cent. because $1,000,000 was 1/11 or 1/12 of the capital invested in
the plants of the telegraph companies. That raised to $1,457,500 Mr.
Scudamore&rsquo;s estimate of the cost of operating the telegraphs on
the supposition of a business of 7,500,000 messages.</p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore then allowed 33 per cent. or $437,250, for the
assumed increase in the number of messages from 7,500,000 to
11,650,000. He said the Post Office might safely assume that it could
increase its business by 55 per cent. at an increase of 33 per cent.
in the operating expenses, since the Electric and International
Telegraph Company recently had increased its business by 105 per
cent. at an increase of 33 per cent. in the operating expenses. Mr.
Scudamore&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
conclusion was that the Post Office could carry 11,650,000 messages,
yielding an income of $3,400,000, at a cost of $1,895,000, thus
obtaining a net revenue of $1,505,000.</p>

<p>To that sum must be added the net revenue to be obtained from the
carriage of messages for the newspaper press, $60,000; and $225,000 to
be obtained from the rental of the State&rsquo;s cables to the several
foreign cable companies. Thus Mr. Scudamore counted on a maximum net
revenue of $1,790,000.</p>

<p>By similar reasoning, under the supposition that the total number
of messages should not exceed 7,500,000, Mr. Scudamore arrived at a
minimum estimated net revenue of $1,015,000. Taking the average of
the two foregoing estimates, he said the Government &ldquo;might with
almost entire certainty rely upon a net revenue within a range of from
$1,000,000 to $1,800,000, the mean of which was $1,400,000.&rdquo; That
was for the first year; in the subsequent years the net revenue would
increase rapidly. He said: &ldquo;It is the experience of all people
who have worked a large business of this kind that the cost does not
by any means increase in proportion to the increase of business; you
can always do a greater amount of business at a less proportionate cost
than you can do a smaller amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Goschen repeatedly asked Mr. Scudamore whether he would stand
by his estimates, and whether he deemed them moderate, adding that the
Select Committee was taking the matter almost exclusively on his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
[Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s] evidence. Mr. Goschen always received
the strongest assurances that the Committee might rely on the
estimates submitted.<a href="#Footnote_58_65" id="FNanchor_58_65"
class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s predictions as to the growth of traffic that
might be expected from the great increase in the facilities for
telegraphing, and from the reduction of the charges by fully one-half,
turned out to be brilliant indeed. They were fully realized. The number
of messages increased from about 6,500,000 in 1869, to 9,850,000 in
1870-71, to 19,253,000 in 1874-75, and to 26,547,000 in 1879-1880.<a
href="#Footnote_59_66" id="FNanchor_59_66" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>But Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s predictions as to the net revenue to be
obtained from the State telegraphs turned out to be appalling blunders.
In only thirteen out of thirty-six years, from 1870-71 to 1905-06, did
the net revenue reach Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s minimum estimate; in only
two of those thirteen years did it reach the maximum estimate; and in
only seven of the thirteen years did it reach the average estimate. In
the period 1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating expenses aggregated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
$231,196,000, while the gross receipts aggregated $229,761,000. In
the latter sum are included $8,552,000, the proceeds of the royalties
paid the Government by the British National Telephone Company for the
privilege of conducting the telephone business in competition with
the State telegraphs.<a href="#Footnote_60_67" id="FNanchor_60_67"
class="fnanchor">60</a> If that sum be excluded from the postal
telegraph gross revenues, as not having been earned by the telegraphs,
it will be found that in the period, 1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating
expenses exceeded the gross revenue by $9,987,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>Operating Expenses under-estimated by
one-half</em></div>

<p>Mr. Scudamore, in 1869, predicted that the operating expenses would
be 51 per cent. to 56 per cent. of the gross revenue, in the first
year of the working of the telegraphs by the Post Office; and that
they would continue to be correspondingly low. In 1875, a Committee
appointed by the Treasury reported that in consequence of the great
extension of facilities effected since 1870, &ldquo;it would be
difficult for the Government to work the Telegraph Service as cheaply
as did the Companies, but a reasonable expectation might be entertained
that the expenses might be kept within 70 per cent. or 75 per cent.
of the gross revenue. That would leave a margin sufficient to pay the
interest on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the debt incurred in purchasing the telegraphs.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_61_68" id="FNanchor_61_68" class="fnanchor">61</a>
As a matter of fact, the operating expenses only once have come
within the limits fixed by the Committee of 1875; and at the close of
1900-01, they had averaged 92.5 per cent.<a href="#Footnote_62_69"
id="FNanchor_62_69" class="fnanchor">62</a> Here again, the telephone
royalties are included in the gross receipts.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1906, the capital invested in the telegraphs
was $84,812,000.<a href="#Footnote_63_70" id="FNanchor_63_70"
class="fnanchor">63</a> To raise that capital, the Government had sold
$54,300,000 three per cent. bonds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
at an average price of about 92.3;<a href="#Footnote_64_71"
id="FNanchor_64_71" class="fnanchor">64</a> and for the rest, the
Government had drawn upon the current revenue raised by taxation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Aggregate Telegraph Deficit</em></div>

<p>The net revenue earned by the telegraphs covered the interest
on the bonds outstanding, in 1870-71, and in the years 1879-80 to
1883-84. On March 31, 1906, the sums annually paid by the Government
by way of interest that had not been earned by the telegraphs, had
aggregated $22,530,000, or 26.5 per cent. of the capital invested
in the telegraphs.<a href="#Footnote_65_72" id="FNanchor_65_72"
class="fnanchor">65</a> Upon the sums invested since 1874, aggregating
$34,534,000, the Government has received no interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Parliament Responsible for Deficits</em></div>

<p>The statement is commonly made, and widely accepted, that the
financial failure of the State telegraphs is due to the excessive price
paid for the plant. But that statement overlooks two facts: that since
1892-93 the telegraphs have not earned operating expenses; and that
in 1880-81 the telegraphs became abundantly able to earn the interest
even upon their immoderate capitalization.<a href="#Footnote_66_73"
id="FNanchor_66_73" class="fnanchor">66</a> The statement in question
also overlooks the fact that the telegraphs easily could have
maintained the position reached in 1880-81, had not the House of
Commons taken the reins out of the hands of the successive Governments
of the day. The House of Commons after 1881 fixed the wages and
salaries to be paid the Government telegraph employees in accordance
with the political pressure those employees were able to bring, not
in accordance with the market value of the services rendered by the
employees. The House of Commons also reduced the tariff on telegrams
from 24 cents for 20 words, to 12 cents for 12 words. It took that
course against the protests of the Government of the day, and cut deep
into the margin of profit of the telegraph department.</p>

<p>The fact that the House of Commons after 1880-81
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
took the reins out of the hands of the successive Governments of the
day, in no way diminished Mr. Scudamore&rsquo;s responsibility for the
appalling errors into which he fell when he forecast the financial
outcome of the nationalization of the telegraphs. Mr. Leeman, of the
Parliamentary Select Committee of 1868, expressly asked Mr. Scudamore:
&ldquo;You do not think there is any fear of the cost being increased
by the salaries being much increased under the management of the
Post Office?&rdquo; Mr. Scudamore without hesitation replied in the
negative, though he had just stated that in the Post Office and in
all Government departments the pay of the lower grades of employees
was somewhat higher than it was in commercial and industrial life.<a
href="#Footnote_67_74" id="FNanchor_67_74" class="fnanchor">67</a>
Moreover, Mr. Scudamore, as one of the two chief executive officers
of the Post Office, must have been aware that the Government was
neither perfectly free to promote men according to their merit, and
irrespective of length of service, nor free to discharge men who were
comparatively inefficient and lax in the discharge of their duties. He
must have known that those disabilities made it impossible for the Post
Office to work as cheaply as private enterprise worked.</p>

<p>As for the House of Commons forcing on the Government the 12 cent
rate for messages of 12 words, that action was due largely to the
expectations raised by Mr. Scudamore himself in 1868 and 1869, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
nationalization of the telegraphs would soon give the public a twelve
cent rate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Mr. W. S. Jevons&rsquo; Disillusionment</em>
</div>

<p>Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, the eminent statistician and economist, who,
in 1866 to 1869, had warmly supported the proposal to nationalize
the telegraphs, in 1875 pointed out that while the postal telegraph
traffic had increased 81 per cent. in the period 1870 to 1874, the
operating expenses had increased 110 per cent. He said: &ldquo;The
case is all the more hopeless, since the introduction of the wonderful
invention of duplex telegraphy has doubled at a stroke, and with
very little cost, the carrying power of many of the wires.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_68_75" id="FNanchor_68_75" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>In 1870 each wire afforded one channel for communication; in 1895
it afforded two channels under the Duplex system, four channels under
the Quadruplex system, and six channels under the Multiplex system. In
1870 the maximum speed per minute was 60 to 80 words. In 1895 the fixed
standard of speed for certain circuits was 400 words, while a speed
of 600 words was possible of attainment. The &ldquo;repeaters&rdquo;
used for strengthening the current on long circuits also were greatly
improved after 1870.<a href="#Footnote_69_76" id="FNanchor_69_76"

      telegraphs in those periods. The first column of the table is
      constructed on the assumption that the interest paid by the
      State for borrowed money was 3.25 per cent. from 1870-71 to
      1883-84; 3 per cent. from 1884-85 to 1888-89; and 2.75 per

      to specific years. </p>

      <p>The results of the year 1870-71 should be ignored, since

   CHAPTER VI <br /><span class="smcap">The Party Leaders Ignore
   Their Fear of an Organized Civil Service</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Mr. Disraeli, Chancellor of the Exchequer, opposes the
   enfranchisement of the civil servants. Mr. Gladstone, Leader
   of the Opposition, assents to enfranchisement, but expresses
   grave apprehensions of evil results.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most extraordinary of the numerous astounding episodes in
connection with the nationalization of the telegraphs was the fact that
in the debates in the House of Commons was not even raised the question
of possible danger arising from increasing enormously the number of
civil servants. That is the more astounding, since, in 1867 and 1868,
prominent men in both political parties had grave misgivings as to
the future relations between the State and its employees, even though
those employees who were in the Customs Department, the Inland Revenue
Department, and the Post Office were at the time disfranchised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Disraeli on Civil Servants</em></div>

<p>In July, 1867, while the House of Commons was passing the
&ldquo;Representation of the People Bill,&rdquo; Sir Harry Verney,
a private member, moved the addition of a clause to enable
public officers connected with the collection of the revenue to
vote at elections.<a href="#Footnote_70_77" id="FNanchor_70_77"
class="fnanchor">70</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Disraeli, asked the House not to
accept the Amendment. He said: &ldquo;He wished also to recall to the
recollection of the committee a Treasury Minute which had been placed
on the table, in which Minute the Government had drawn attention to the
impropriety and impolicy of officers in those branches of the public
service to which the honorable baronet [Sir Harry Verney] had referred,
exercising their influence over Members of Parliament, in order to urge
upon the Government an increase of their salaries. Even at the present
time an influence was exerted which must be viewed with great jealousy,
and every Government, however constituted, would find it necessary to
use its utmost influence in restricting overtures of that description.
But what would be the position of affairs if these persons&mdash;so
numerous a body&mdash;were invested with the franchise. From the
experience of what was passing in this city&mdash;and he wished merely
to intimate, and not to dwell upon the circumstance&mdash;he was led
to believe the result would be that there would be an organization
illegitimately to increase the remuneration they received for their
services&mdash;a remuneration which, in his opinion, was based upon
a just estimate. He did not deny that the class referred to by the
honorable baronet were entirely worthy of public confidence, but the
conferring the franchise upon them would place them in a new position,
and would introduce into public life new influences which would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
not be of a beneficial character. He trusted therefore that
the committee would not sanction the proposal of the honorable
baronet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The amendment was lost; and in the following year, 1868, Mr.
Monk, a private member, carried against the Government of the day, a
bill to enfranchise the revenue officers.<a href="#Footnote_71_78"
id="FNanchor_71_78" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>The Chancellor of the Exchequer on Civil
Servants</em></div>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. G. W. Hunt, said he felt bound
to move that the bill be committed this day three months&mdash;<span
lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, be rejected. He said it was an anomaly in the
laws that the dockyard laborers were not disfranchised. &ldquo;If the
matter were inquired into calmly and dispassionately, he was not at
all sure that a good case might not be made out for affixing to them
the same disability that is now attached to the revenue officers. The
fact did not at all tend to the purity or the impartiality of electors
in places where many of these men were employed, and strenuous efforts
were made by members representing them to increase the privileges of
the dockyard men and the number of persons employed, which did not
tend to economy or the proper husbanding of the national resources.
Continual applications were made by these gentlemen [the employees in
the Revenue Departments] respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
their position and salaries, and these applications had of late
years taken a very peculiar form, being not merely made through the
heads of departments, or by simple memorial to the treasury, but
in the form of resolutions at public meetings held by them, and
communications to Members of Parliament by delegates appointed to
represent their interests. He put it to the House, whether, in the
circumstances supposed, the influence possessed by them would not
be very considerably increased, and whether the Government of the
day would not have far greater difficulty in administering these
departments with respect to the position and salaries of the officers
concerned, if the measure were carried.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_72_79"
id="FNanchor_72_79" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Warning</em></div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone said: &ldquo;The suggestion he would make would be
that Parliament should give the vote, and, at the same time, leave it
in the discretion of the Government of the day to inhibit any of these
officers from taking any part in politics beyond giving their simple
vote&hellip;. Again, before they proceeded to lay down the principle
of general enfranchisement, one thing to be considered was the very
peculiar relations between the revenue officers and the Members of that
House. There it was necessary to speak plainly. He was not afraid of
Government influence in that matter, nor of an influence in favor of
one political party or another; but he owned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that he had some apprehension of what might be called class influence
in that House, which in his opinion was the great reproach of the
Reformed Parliament, as he believed history would record. Whether
they were going to emerge into a new state of things in which class
influence would be weaker he knew not; but that class influence had
been in many things evil and a scandal to them, especially for the
last fifteen or twenty years; and he was fearful of its increase
in consequence of the possession of the franchise, through the
power which men who, as members of a regular service, were already
organized, might bring to bear on Members of Parliament. What, he
asked, was the Civil Service of this country? It was a service in
which there was a great deal of complaint of inadequate pay, of slow
promotion, and all the rest of it. But, at the same time, it was a
service which there was an extraordinary desire to get into. And whose
privilege was it to regulate that desire? That of the Members of that
House&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

   CHAPTER VII <br /><span class="smcap">The House of Commons
   Is Responsible for the Financial Failure of the State
   Telegraphs</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Sir S. Northcote, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Mr.
   Disraeli&rsquo;s Ministry of 1874 to 1880, is disillusioned. The
   State telegraphs become self-supporting in 1879-80. The House
   of Commons, under the leadership of Dr. Cameron, M. P. for
   Glasgow, overrides the Ministry and cuts the tariff almost in
   two. In 1890-91 the State telegraphs would again have become
   self-supporting, had not the House of Commons, under pressure
   from the civil service unions, increased wages and salaries.
   The necessity of making money is the only effective incentive
   to sound management.</p>
</div>

<p>The consideration of the reasons for the financial failure of
the State telegraphs may begin with the discussion of the effect
of the building of unremunerative extensions. In 1873 the Treasury
Department forced the Post Office Department to abandon the doctrine
that every place with a money order issuing post office was of right
entitled to a telegraph office. The treasury in that year adopted the
policy of demanding a guarantee from private individuals whenever
it did not care to assume the risk of a telegraph office failing to
be self-supporting.<a href="#Footnote_73_80" id="FNanchor_73_80"
class="fnanchor">73</a> The new policy, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
applied only to places not yet provided with telegraphic service,
for the withdrawal of an established service would have led
&ldquo;to an immense amount of public inconvenience and agitation
that the Government would have been unable to resist.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_74_81" id="FNanchor_74_81" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sir S. Northcote&rsquo;s
Disillusionment</em></div>

<p>In speaking of the policy of requiring guarantees in order to check
the pressure brought by the House of Commons for additional telegraphic
services, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Northcote, in
1875, said: &ldquo;The Government cannot give the answer that private
companies could, and I am sure did, give. This is a point worthy of
consideration, not so much in regard to the telegraph service itself,
in which we are now fairly embarked, and of which we must make the
best we can, as in reference to suggestions of acquisitions of other
forms of property, and the conduct of other kinds of business, in
which I hope the House will never be led to embark without very
carefully weighing the results of this remarkable experiment.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_75_82" id="FNanchor_75_82" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>The guarantee in question, which had to be given by private
individuals, covered: the annual working expenses; interest on the
capital investment; sinking fund payments which should repay in seven
years the capital invested; and a margin for certain contingencies.<a
href="#Footnote_76_83" id="FNanchor_76_83" class="fnanchor">76</a> In
August, 1891, was abolished the provision
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
requiring a guarantee of the repayment of the capital in seven years.<a
href="#Footnote_77_84" id="FNanchor_77_84" class="fnanchor">77</a>
At the same time, the local governments were authorized to give the
guarantee that continued to be required.<a href="#Footnote_78_85"
id="FNanchor_78_85" class="fnanchor">78</a> In 1897, upon the occasion
of Her late Majesty&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee, the Treasury authorized
the Post Office to assume one-half of the burden of non-paying
telegraphic services; and since May 1, 1906, the Post Office assumes
two-thirds of that burden.<a href="#Footnote_79_86" id="FNanchor_79_86"
class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>The guarantees demanded after 1873 proved an effective check
upon log-rolling. For example, in 1876, Catrine, in Ayrshire, with
a population of 2,000, still was without telegraph service, while
Tarbolton, in Ayrshire, population 500, had acquired such service
previous to 1873.<a href="#Footnote_80_87" id="FNanchor_80_87"
class="fnanchor">80</a> In the period from 1874 to 1878 the number of
postal telegraph offices increased only from 3,756 to 3,761.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject, it is necessary to warn the reader
against misleading tables published in several official documents,
and purporting to show that non-paying offices rapidly became
self-supporting.<a href="#Footnote_81_88" id="FNanchor_81_88"
class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Those tables are constructed on the basis of including in the cost
of telegraph offices only the allowance to the local postmaster for
telegraph work, and the cost of maintaining the instruments in the
office, and of excluding the cost of maintaining the wire, the cost
of additional force required at the central station in London and at
the district centres because of the large number of outlying branches,
as well as the interest on the capital invested. Those omissions led
the Treasury Committee of 1875 to say: &ldquo;We fear the full cost
of working these numerous and unremunerative offices is not realized
[appreciated].&rdquo; In 1888, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Third Secretary
to the Post Office, was asked by a Select Committee of Parliament:
&ldquo;Where you have established telegraph offices at money order
offices under guarantee from individuals interested, do you find
that eventually these offices pay?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;No; in
exceedingly few instances do they pay. The guarantee has continued, and
after seven years we have got a fresh guarantee in order to continue
the office.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_82_89" id="FNanchor_82_89"
class="fnanchor">82</a> Mr. Patey&rsquo;s testimony is corroborated by
the continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and successful, agitation of the House of Commons for the reduction of
the guarantee demanded by the Treasury.</p>

<p>The second reason for the financial failure of the State telegraphs
is, that while the precipitate reductions made in the rates charged
to the public led to a great increase in the number of messages
transmitted, that very increase of business was accompanied by such
<del>augumented</del><ins>augmented</ins> operating expenses, that some
years elapsed before the reduced average margin of profit per message
carried sufficed to pay the interest on the immoderate capitalization
of the State telegraphs. The increase in the operating expenses was
in part inevitable; in part it was due to the waste inherent in all
business operations conducted by executive officers who hold office,
either at the pleasure of legislative bodies elected by manhood
suffrage, or at the pleasure of large bodies of voters.</p>

<p>In 1876, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Principal Clerk in the Post Office
Department, stated that the average of the operating expenses
per telegraphic message transmitted was 16 cents to 18 cents.<a
href="#Footnote_83_90" id="FNanchor_83_90" class="fnanchor">83</a> At
that time, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
traffic of 21,000,000 messages a year, and average receipts per message
of 28 cents, the net revenue of the telegraphs was $1,060,000, while
the interest on the bonds outstanding was $1,475,000. In 1879-80, with
a traffic of 24,500,000 messages, average receipts per message of 26
cents, the telegraphs yielded a net revenue of $1,667,000, while the
interest on the bonds outstanding was $1,632,000. And in 1880-81, with
a traffic of 27,300,000 messages, the net revenue rose to $2,257,000,
while the interest on the bonds outstanding remained at $1,632,000. A
large part of that improvement was due to a diminution in the waste
with which the telegraphs had been conducted in 1874 to 1878. The
nature and the extent of that waste are indicated in the fact that
the number of clerks, telegraphists, and subordinate engineers was
reduced from 6,783 in 1876, to 6,220 in 1880,<a href="#Footnote_84_91"
id="FNanchor_84_91" class="fnanchor">84</a> at the same time that the
number of telegraph offices was increased from 3,741 to 3,929, and the
number of messages was increased from 21,000,000 to 24,500,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Telegraphs become self-supporting</em>
</div>

<p>In 1880-81, the telegraphs earned 3.25 per cent. on $69,455,000,<a
href="#Footnote_85_92" id="FNanchor_85_92" class="fnanchor">85</a>
which was $16,180,000 in excess of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
total capital invested in them. Under conditions which shall be
described on a subsequent page, the Government, &ldquo;very much at
the instance of the House of Commons,&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_86_93"
id="FNanchor_86_93" class="fnanchor">86</a> raised wages and salaries,
so that, in the period from 1880-81 to 1884-85, the expenses on account
of salaries and wages increased $1,100,325, while the gross receipts
increased only $752,635. In 1884-85, the net revenue sufficed to pay
the interest at 3.25 per cent. on $45,710,000 only.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on March 29, 1883, the House of Commons had carried
against the Government of the day, the resolution of Dr. Cameron,
Member of Parliament from Glasgow: &ldquo;That the time has arrived
when the minimum charge for Inland Postal Telegrams should be reduced
to 12 cents.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_87_94" id="FNanchor_87_94"
class="fnanchor">87</a> Dr. Cameron said: &ldquo;He brought forward
the motion&mdash;and he did so last year<a href="#Footnote_88_95"
id="FNanchor_88_95" class="fnanchor">88</a>&mdash;because he was
absolutely opposed to the taxation of telegrams [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.
e.</span>, to raising more revenue from the telegraphs than was
requisite to paying the interest on the bonds outstanding]; and he
believed that taxation could be levied in no other manner that would be
so prejudicial to the commerce, intercourse, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
convenience of the country. At the present moment there was practically
no taxation of telegrams, or, at all events, the principle of the
taxation of telegrams had not been affirmed. The surplus revenue
[above the interest on the debt outstanding] earned up to the present
time had been so small that it was impossible by sacrificing it to
confer any substantial advantage upon the public. But the telegraph
revenue was increasing; and it appeared to him that they had now
arrived at a point where a remission of taxation must be made in the
shape of extra facilities [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, reduced
charges] for the public, or the vicious principle of the taxation of
telegrams for the purpose of revenue must be affirmed. They had, it
might be contended, not yet exactly arrived at that point, but they
were remarkably near it; and his object in bringing forward the motion
from year to year had been to afford the Government no excuse for
allowing the point to be passed, but to bring up the subject every
year; and the moment it was admitted that a change could be made
without loss to the taxpayers he should ask the House to indicate its
opinions that the change might be made&hellip;. He maintained that the
principle of taxing telegrams was most erroneous. It was one of the
worst taxes on knowledge<a href="#Footnote_89_96" id="FNanchor_89_96"
class="fnanchor">89</a>&mdash;a tax on economy, on time, and on
the production of wealth. Instead of maintaining a price which was
prohibitory not only to the working
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
classes but also to the middle classes, they ought to take every means
to encourage telegraphy. They ought to educate the rising generation
to it; and he would suggest to the Government that the composing of
telegrams would form a useful part of the education in our board
schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Childers, &ldquo;hoped the
House would not agree to the motion&rdquo; even if it were ready to
accept Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s estimate that the immediate reduction in
the net revenue would not exceed $850,000. &ldquo;He had heard with
surprise in the course of the debate some of the statements which had
been made in regard to the unimportance of large items of expenditure
[and of revenue]; and he was all the more surprised when he remembered
the great anxiety which had been expressed during the present session
in regard to the Public Expenditure, and the care which ought to be
taken over it.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_90_97" id="FNanchor_90_97"
class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Dr. Cameron, in the course of his speech in 1882, quoted a statement
recently made by Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, to the effect that
there was an average of 80,000 telegrams a day for 5,600 offices,
or 14 telegrams per office. The representative from Glasgow added:
&ldquo;The state of things which they now had, therefore amounted
to this&mdash;that from each telegraph office was sent a number of
messages which afforded a little over half an hour&rsquo;s work per day
for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the operator. It would, therefore, at once be seen that there
was ample room for increased business, without any increase of
expenditure.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_91_98" id="FNanchor_91_98"
class="fnanchor">91</a> The foregoing argument overlooked the fact
that the wires between the large cities were being worked to something
like their full capacity; and that the low average of 14 messages
per office was due solely to the existence of hundreds of offices
in small places that had very little traffic. And shortly after the
House of Commons had passed Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s resolution, in 1883,
against the protest of the Government, the Treasury authorized the Post
Office to spend $2,500,000 in putting up 15,000 miles of additional
wires, and in otherwise preparing for the great increase in business
that would arise between the larger towns in consequence of the
reduction of the tariff.<a href="#Footnote_92_99" id="FNanchor_92_99"
class="fnanchor">92</a> And by July 5, 1885, three months before
the date set for putting into force the reduced rate, the Post
Office had engaged 1,202 additional telegraphists and learners,<a
href="#Footnote_93_100" id="FNanchor_93_100" class="fnanchor">93</a> to
assist in doing the business which Dr. Cameron in 1882, had said could
be done &ldquo;without any great increase of expenditure.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tariff is cut almost in two</em></div>

<p>On March 30, 1885, Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, Postmaster General, brought in
a bill to give effect to Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
resolution of March 29, 1883.<a href="#Footnote_94_101"
id="FNanchor_94_101" class="fnanchor">94</a> The measure provided for
a rate of 12 cents for not exceeding 12 words, address to be counted,
and one cent for each additional word. The Postmaster General began by
reminding the House of Commons that Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s resolution had
been carried against the Government, and by a considerable majority.
That the Post Office has spent $2,500,000 in preparing for the increase
of business anticipated from the 12 cent tariff. That the loss of net
revenue was estimated at $900,000 for the first year; and that it would
take four years to recover that loss. That since Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s
resolution had been passed, the financial position of the telegraph
department had grown &ldquo;decidedly worse,&rdquo; the net revenue
having fallen from $2,200,000 to $1,275,000, the latter sum yielding
barely 2.5 per cent. on the capital invested in the telegraphs,
$55,000,000. Mr. Shaw-Lefevre said the decrease in the net revenue had
been due &ldquo;to the very considerable additions to the salaries
of the telegraphists and other officers made two or three years ago
very much at the instance of honorable Members of the House, and which
Mr. Fawcett [the then Postmaster General] considered to be absolutely
necessary,&rdquo; and also to increased cost of maintenance<a
href="#Footnote_95_102" id="FNanchor_95_102" class="fnanchor">95</a>
arising from the necessity of replacing worn-out plant. The Postmaster
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
General also drew attention to the fact that a new and dangerous
factor had appeared: the competition of the telephone.<a
href="#Footnote_96_103" id="FNanchor_96_103" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>The Bill became law; and the 12 cent tariff went into effect on
October 1, 1885, the close of the first half of the fiscal year
1885-86. The number of messages jumped from 33,000,000 to 50,000,000,
while the net revenue dropped from $1,370,000 to $440,000. In the next
three years, 1887-88 to 1889-90, the number of messages increased
to 62,400,000, and the net revenue rose to $1,451,000, or within
$431,000 of the interest on the capital invested, $62,748,000. In the
following year, 1890-91, the messages continued to increase at the
rate at which they had increased in the three preceding years, and
the net revenue would once more have sufficed to pay the interest on
the capital invested, had the operating expenses not been swollen by
increases in wages and salaries granted under pressure brought by
the telegraph employees upon the House of Commons. The raising of
salaries and wages continued through the subsequent years; and in the
thirteen years 1893-94 to 1905-06, the State telegraphs have earned
the operating expenses in five years only.<a href="#Footnote_97_104"
id="FNanchor_97_104" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>In 1888, the <cite>Select Committee on Revenue Departments
Estimates</cite> reported as follows: &ldquo;Your Committee are of the
opinion that the reasons urged against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
treating the Post Office as a commercial business are not applicable
in anything like the same degree to the Telegraph Department; and that
the increasing annual deficit in the accounts of the latter cannot be
viewed otherwise than with grave concern. Looking to the increasing
costliness of the service as a whole, and to the constant pressure
upon it of demands for increased and unprofitable expenditure, your
committee deem it their duty to call attention to the fact that the
Department of the Postmaster General, in all its branches, is a vast
Government business, which is most likely to continue to be conducted
satisfactorily, if it should also continue to be conducted with a view
to profit [beyond the payment of interest on the debt outstanding],
as one of the revenue yielding departments of the State. Excessive
expenditure appears to your committee to be sooner or later inevitable
in a great Government business which is not administered with a view to
an ultimate profit to the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the House of Commons permitted the successive Governments of
the day to act upon the doctrine contained in the foregoing quotation,
the State telegraphs would have been self-supporting ever since the
year 1880-81. They would have paid the full interest upon the whole
capital invested in them; in spite of the high prices paid to the
telegraph companies and the railway companies for the sale of those
companies&rsquo; plants and rights.</p>

     CHAPTER VIII <br /><span class="smcap">The State Telegraphs
     Subsidize the Newspaper Press</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Why the newspaper press demanded nationalization. Mr.
   Scudamore gives the newspaper press a tariff which he deems
   unprofitable. Estimates of the loss involved in transmitting
   press messages, made by responsible persons in the period from
   1876 to 1900. The State telegraphs subsidize betting on horse
   races.</p>
</div>

<p>Before proceeding with the further discussion of the intervention of
the House of Commons in the details of the administration of the State
telegraphs, it is necessary to review briefly the tariff on messages
for the newspaper press.</p>

<p>Before the telegraphs had been acquired by the State, the telegraph
companies maintained a press bureau which supplied the newspapers with
reports of the debates in Parliament, foreign news, general news, a
certain amount of London financial and commercial intelligence, and
the more important sporting news. While Parliament was in session,
the messages in question averaged about 6,000 words a day; during the
remainder of the year they averaged about 4,000 words daily. The
annual subscription charges for the aforesaid services ranged from $750
to $1,250. Before the Select Committee of 1868, the representatives of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the newspapers asserted that those subscription charges yielded the
telegraph companies, on an average, 8 cents per 100 words. They
further asserted that the telegraph companies ascribed 62.5 per cent.
of the cost of the press bureau to the transmission of the news;
and 37.5 per cent. to the collecting and editing of the news.<a
href="#Footnote_98_105" id="FNanchor_98_105" class="fnanchor">98</a>
But neither the representatives of the press, nor the Select Committee
itself, called any representatives of the telegraph companies to
testify upon these latter points.</p>

<p>The subscribers to the companies&rsquo; press bureau service also
were allowed to send messages at one-half the rate charged to the
general public; and in case the same newspaper message was sent to
several newspapers in the same town, the charge for each address after
the first one was 25 per cent. of the sum charged the first addressee.
By co&ouml;peration, therefore, the newspapers in the larger towns
were able to obtain considerable reductions from the initial charge,
which, as already stated, was 50 per cent. of the tariff charged
the general public.<a href="#Footnote_99_106" id="FNanchor_99_106"
class="fnanchor">99</a> Apparently, however, little use was made of
these privileges. In 1868, for instance, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
subscriptions to the press bureau aggregated $150,000, whereas
the sums paid for messages to individual newspapers aggregated
only $10,000.<a href="#Footnote_100_107" id="FNanchor_100_107"
class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Newspapers&rsquo; Grievance</em></div>

<p>The newspaper proprietors admitted that the charges for the
press bureau service were entirely reasonable; but they desired to
organize their own press bureaux on the ground that they were the
better judges of what news the public wanted. Since the telegraph
companies would not give up their press bureau, the newspaper
proprietors joined in the agitation for the nationalization of
the telegraphs.<a href="#Footnote_101_108" id="FNanchor_101_108"
class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>As soon as the Government began to negotiate with the telegraph
companies for the purchase of their plants, the newspaper proprietors
organized a committee to protect their interests and to represent them
before the Select Committee to which had been referred the Electric
Telegraphs Bill of 1868. That Bill had said that the tariff was to be
uniform, irrespective of distance, and was not to exceed 24 cents for
20 words, address not to be counted. It had said nothing on the subject
of the tariff to be charged to the newspaper press.</p>

<p>On May 15, 1868, Mr. Scudamore had written the Committee of the
newspaper proprietors: &ldquo;As a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of course the Post Office would not undertake to collect news any
more than it would undertake to write letters for the public,
but the news being collected, it could, and I submit, ought, to
transmit it at rates at least as low as those now charged, and
which though they are unquestionably low, are still believed to
yield the companies a considerable profit&hellip;. It seems to
me, indeed, that the transmission of news to the press throughout
the United Kingdom should be regarded as a matter of national
importance and that the charge of such transmission should include
no greater margin of profit than would suffice to make the
service fairly self-supporting.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_102_109"
id="FNanchor_102_109" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Thereupon the newspaper proprietors demanded: &ldquo;That the
maximum rate for the transmission of telegraphic messages [for
newspapers] should not exceed that which is now paid by each
individual proprietor [as a subscriber to the companies&rsquo;
press bureau], which is, for transmission, exclusive of the cost of
collection, 4 cents per 100 words.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_103_110"
id="FNanchor_103_110" class="fnanchor">103</a> This demand assumed that
the companies&rsquo; charge of 8 cents per 100 words was remunerative;
that it was made up of two separable parts: a charge for transmission,
and a charge for collecting and editing; and that the charge ascribed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
transmission still would remain remunerative even after the charge
ascribed to collecting and editing had been withdrawn. Upon none of
these several points were the officers of the telegraph companies asked
to testify, the statements of the newspaper proprietors being allowed
to stand unsupported.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Scudamore yields to the newspapers</em></div>

<p>In order to insure the payment of an average sum of 4 cents or 5
cents per 100 words, the newspaper proprietors proposed that messages
be transmitted for the newspapers &ldquo;at rates not exceeding 24 cents
for every 100 words transmitted at night, and at rates not exceeding
24 cents for every 75 words transmitted by day, to a single address,
with an additional charge of 4 cents for every 100 words, or for every
75 words, as the case may be, of the same telegram so transmitted to
every additional address.&rdquo; By way of compromise, Mr. Scudamore proposed
a charge of 24 cents for 75 words or 100 words for each separate town
to which each message might be sent, and the limitation of the 4 cent
copy rate to copies delivered by hand in the same town. Mr. Scudamore,
however, withdrew that proposal, and accepted the proposition of the
newspaper proprietors, which became the law. It is needless to add that
the opposition of the newspaper press to the Bill of 1868 would have
delayed the passage of that Bill even more than any opposition on the
part of the telegraph companies and railway companies could have done.
Indeed, it is probable, that the newspaper press could have defeated
the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1875 the Treasury appointed a &ldquo;<cite>Committee to
investigate the Causes of the Increased Cost of the Telegraphic Service
since the Acquisition of the Telegraphs by the State</cite>.&rdquo;
That committee consisted of three prominent officers taken from the
Post Office Department and other departments of State. Upon the
newspaper tariff fixed by the Act of 1868, the Committee reported:
&ldquo;The consequences of such a system must be obvious to every one.
Even at ordinary times the wires are always largely occupied with
press work, and at extraordinary times they are absolutely flooded
with this most unremunerative traffic, which not only fills the wires
unduly to the exclusion of better paying matter, but necessitates
a much larger staff than would be necessary with a more reasonable
system [of charges].<a href="#Footnote_104_111" id="FNanchor_104_111"
class="fnanchor">104</a> After very careful consideration of these
points, Mr. Weaver [one of the members of the committee, and the former
Secretary of the Electric and International Telegraph Company], has
no hesitation in expressing his opinion that the principle of the
stipulations of the tariff authorized by the Telegraph Act, 1868, both
as regards messages transmitted for the public, and those forwarded for
the press, is essentially unsound, and has been the main cause of the
large percentage of expenditure as compared with the gross revenue. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
order to provide for the prompt and efficient transmission of the
vast amount of matter produced by such a system, a considerable
extension of plant was necessary, involving a large original cost,
besides a regular yearly outlay for maintenance and renewal, and
not only so, but a large and constantly increasing staff had to be
provided to work lines, which, if taken separately, would not be found
to produce anything approaching to the cost entailed for erecting,
working, and maintaining them. It will be obvious, therefore, that,
unless a retrograde step be taken in order to amend the principles
upon which the stipulations of the tariff are made up, it would be
unreasonable to expect that the revenue derived for telegraph messages
under the present system can ever be made to cover the expenses of
working, the interest upon capital, and the ultimate extinction of
the debt.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_105_112" id="FNanchor_105_112"
class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>In May, 1876, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Principal Clerk in the Post Office
Department, testified that the Post Office was losing $100,000 a year
by transmitting 220,000,000 words for the newspaper press at an average
price of 8 cents per 100 words. Mr. Patey said 180,000,000 words were
being carried at the rate of 4 cents per 100 words, or for $74,180 in
the aggregate; and 40,000,000 were being transmitted at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
rate of 24 cents per 100 words, or, for $109,795 in the aggregate.<a
href="#Footnote_106_113" id="FNanchor_106_113" class="fnanchor">106</a>
Mr. Patey submitted no calculations in support of his statement
that there had been a loss of $100,000 on newspaper messages
yielding $183,975. But he cited two illustrations from Hull and the
Nottingham-Sheffield-Leeds-Bradford group of towns. He stated that
the Post Office received $1,600 a year for messages transmitted to
six newspapers in Hull, and spent $5,275 on the transmission of those
messages. He added that the service supplied to nineteen towns included
in the Nottingham-Sheffield-Leeds-Bradford group of towns yielded
$21,760, and cost the Post Office $38,270.<a href="#Footnote_107_114"
id="FNanchor_107_114" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>In 1876, the Postmaster General, through Mr. S. A. Blackwood,
Financial Secretary to the Post Office,<a href="#Footnote_108_115"
id="FNanchor_108_115" class="fnanchor">108</a> asked the Select
Committee on the Post Office (Telegraph Department) to recommend
to Parliament that the tariff on newspaper press messages be made
&ldquo;24 cents for 75 words or 100 words for each separate town to
which each message may be sent, and that the 4 cent copy rate be
limited to copies delivered by hand in the same town.&rdquo; That, it
will be remembered, was the proposal made and withdrawn in 1868 by Mr.
Scudamore. The Select Committee recommended that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the amount of the loss on the newspaper press messages be clearly
ascertained, and that the copy rates be raised sufficiently to cover
that loss. But Parliament failed to act on the recommendation.</p>

<p>Mr. Patey had supported Mr. Blackwood&rsquo;s request with the
statement, based upon inquiry of postmasters throughout the United
Kingdom, that &ldquo;in a very large number of towns only a small part
of the telegraphic news transmitted was inserted in the newspapers.
In many cases, on inquiry of the proprietors, it was stated that it
was not inserted inasmuch as it was not of interest to the readers. In
other cases, because the amount of local news was more than would admit
of the special telegraphic news being inserted.&rdquo; Mr. Patey also
had quoted from a recent issue of the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite> the
statement, that &ldquo;there was not a leading provincial paper in the
Kingdom, the sub-editorial room of which was not littered in the small
hours of the morning ankle deep with rejected telegraph flimsy;&rdquo;
and from a recent issue of the <cite>Freeman&rsquo;s Journal</cite>:
&ldquo;The fact is, that the Post Office, and the better class of
papers as well, are both over-pressed with these cheap duplicate
telegrams. We suppose we pay for about ten times as many as we print.
Though we get them, and pay for them, so as to insure having the best
news from every quarter, we regard them rather as a nuisance, and would
be glad to have them reduced in quantity.&rdquo; And finally, Mr. Patey
had argued that the newspaper press was able to pay much more than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it did pay, &ldquo;inasmuch as there had been a tendency on the part
of the papers generally, not confined only to the large papers,&rdquo;
to get their news by special messages prepared by their own agents
and not sent in duplicate to any extent.<a href="#Footnote_109_116"
id="FNanchor_109_116" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Before the <cite>Select Committee on the Revenue Departments
Estimates</cite>, 1888, Mr. C. H. B. Patey, Third Secretary to the
Post Office, stated: &ldquo;We believe that the tariff under which
the press messages are sent in this country causes a loss amounting
to nearly $1,000,000 a year.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_110_117"
id="FNanchor_110_117" class="fnanchor">110</a> In August, 1888, in
the House of Commons, Mr. Cochrane-Baillie asked the Postmaster
General &ldquo;whether in view of the <cite>Report of the Committee
on the Revenue Departments Estimates</cite>, he could state that the
Government would bring in further legislation to relieve the country
from the loss incurred by the present arrangement in connection with
press telegrams?&rdquo; The Postmaster General replied that &ldquo;he
was quite in accord with the Committee on Revenue Departments but he
feared it would be difficult to effect any change, since the newspaper
press tariff was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
fixed by the Act of 1868, and had been in force for upward of eighteen
years.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_111_118" id="FNanchor_111_118"
class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Annual loss on Newspaper Messages estimated at $1,500,000</em>
</div>

<p>In November, 1893, Mr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, stated
in the House of Commons that &ldquo;the best estimate that can be
formed by the officials at the Post Office points to the loss on
the newspaper press telegrams being at least $1,500,000 a year;
and it probably is still more.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_112_119"
id="FNanchor_112_119" class="fnanchor">112</a> In April, 1895, Mr.
Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, repeated the foregoing statement,
and &ldquo;maintained it in spite of various statements to the contrary
in the newspapers.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;and I should be quite
willing to arrange for an impartial investigation such as is suggested
by the Right Honorable Gentleman, if I were to receive satisfactory
assurances that the press would abide by the result of an inquiry, and
would undertake not to oppose the passage of the necessary legislation
for a corresponding revision in the charges, if it should be shown that
they are insufficient to provide for the cost of the service.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_113_120" id="FNanchor_113_120" class="fnanchor">113</a>
The assurances were not forthcoming; and the newspaper press tariff
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>In April, 1900, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, and representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster
General, a member of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the House of Lords, said: &ldquo;The penny postage realizes an
enormous revenue and brings in a profit, but every other part of the
Post Office work is carried on at a loss. The whole profit is on the
penny letter.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_114_121" id="FNanchor_114_121"
class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Betting on Horse Races subsidized</em></div>

<p>The Telegraph Act of 1868 provided that newspaper rates should be
given to &ldquo;the proprietor or occupier of any news room, club, or
exchange room.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_115_122" id="FNanchor_115_122"
class="fnanchor">115</a> The clubs or exchange rooms in question are
largely what we should term &ldquo;pool-rooms,&rdquo; places maintained
for the purpose of affording the public facilities for betting
on horse races.<a href="#Footnote_116_123" id="FNanchor_116_123"
class="fnanchor">116</a> In 1876 Mr. Saunders, proprietor of the
Central News Press Association, testified that his association would
send in the course of a day to the same list of addressees the results
of a number of races.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
The words in the several messages might not aggregate 75 words, and
thus his association would be charged for the transmission of one
message only. In that way a number of messages would be transmitted
&ldquo;gratuitously.&rdquo; Mr. Saunders added that, in 1875, the
Post Office had transmitted gratuitously for his association 446,000
sporting messages. Mr. Patey, Third Clerk in the Post Office, added
that while the Post Office received 4 cents for transmitting from 8
to 10 sporting messages, it had to make 8 to 10 separate deliveries,
by messenger boy, on account of those messages which were counted as
one; and that each such delivery cost the Post Office on an average
two cents. Thus, on a recent date, the Post Office had delivered the
results of the Lichfield races to 205 addressees by means of 1,640
separate deliveries, and had received for the service, on an average,
one-half a cent per separate message.<a href="#Footnote_117_124"
id="FNanchor_117_124" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>In January, 1876, the Post Office discontinued the &ldquo;continuous
counting&rdquo; of sporting messages.<a href="#Footnote_118_125"
id="FNanchor_118_125" class="fnanchor">118</a> It took the Department
six years to summon the courage to make this change whereby was
effected some diminution of the burden cast upon the general body of
taxpayers for the benefit of the sporting element among the voters of
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem, however, that the practice of &ldquo;continuous
counting&rdquo; had been resumed at some subsequent date. For, in
March, 1906, in reply to a question from Mr. Sloan, M. P., the
Postmaster General, Mr. Sydney Buxton, said: &ldquo;Clubs are, under
section 16 of the Telegraph Act of 1868, entitled to the benefit of
the very low telegraph rates accorded to press messages; and I have no
power to discriminate against a legitimate club because it is used for
betting purposes. I propose to consider whether the section ought not
to be amended in certain respects.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_119_126"
id="FNanchor_119_126" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>On December 31, 1875, the Post Office discontinued entirely the
practice&mdash;voluntarily assumed&mdash;of transmitting sporting
messages to so-called hotels, in reality saloons. The waste of the
public funds that the Post Office had incurred in response to pressure
from the publicans, is illustrated in Mr. Patey&rsquo;s statement that
the Post Office had received from a certain Liverpool hotel $0.82 a
week for messages which had entailed a weekly expenditure of $2.50 for
messenger service alone.</p>

</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>British Government&rsquo;s policy as to wages and salaries for
   routine work, as distinguished from work requiring a high
   order of intelligence. The Fawcett revision of wages, 1881.
   Lord Frederick Cavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
   on pressure exerted on Members of Parliament by the telegraph
   employees. Sir S. A. Blackwood, Permanent Secretary to the
   Post Office, on the Fawcett revision of 1881. Evidence as to
   civil servants&rsquo; pressure on Members of Parliament presented

   Committee on the Indoor Staff, which Committee had recommended
   increases in order &ldquo;to end agitation.&rdquo; The Earl Compton, M.
   P., champions the cause of the postal employees in 1890; and
   moves for a Select Committee in 1891. Sir James Fergusson,
   Postmaster General in the Salisbury Ministry, issues an
   order against Post Office servants &ldquo;endeavoring to extract
   promises from any candidate for election to the House of

</div>

<p>At the time of the transfer of the telegraphs to the State,
February, 1870, the average weekly wages paid by the telegraph
companies to the telegraphists in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
seven largest cities of the United Kingdom, was $5.14 for the male
staff, and $3.56 for the female staff. That average for the male
staff includes the salaries of the supervisors; if the latter be
excluded, the average for the rank and file of the male employees
will fall to $4.80.<a href="#Footnote_120_127" id="FNanchor_120_127" class="fnanchor">120</a> In 1872, two years after the transfer, the
average wage of the male telegraphists in the offices of Metropolitan
London was $6.56, while the average wage of the female clerks was
$4.30. For the United Kingdom exclusive of London, the average wage
of the telegraphists was $5.46 for the male employees, and $4.50 for
the female employees.<a href="#Footnote_121_128" id="FNanchor_121_128" class="fnanchor">121</a> The latter averages record a larger increase
of wages in the period 1870 to 1872, than would appear at first blush
upon comparison with the average of 1870, namely: $4.80 for men
telegraphists and $3.56 for women telegraphists. For while the figures
for 1872 record the averages for the whole United Kingdom exclusive of
London, those for 1870 record the averages of the seven largest cities
only.</p>

<p>The increases in wages and salaries in the years 1870 to 1872 were
due mainly to the all round rise in wages and salaries that occurred
in the United Kingdom in the period from 1868 to 1872. In the case of
the telegraphists the rise in wages was postponed until
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
1870 to 1872, for the reason that the telegraph companies, as much
as possible, adhered to the past scale of wages and salaries on
account of the pending transfer of their properties to the State.<a href="#Footnote_122_129" id="FNanchor_122_129" class="fnanchor">122</a>
The companies were able to pursue the policy in question by
refraining from increasing their forces materially, working their
old staff over-time. In part, however, the increase in the wages of
the telegraphists after the transfer of the telegraphs to the Post
Office was due to the fact that the Government was obliged to pay the
employees in the Telegraph Department something more than the rates of
wages prevailing in the open market. For, previous to the acquisition
of the telegraphs, the Government had established the policy of paying
its employees more than the open market rate for work requiring
only fidelity and diligence in the performances of routine duty, as
distinguished from work requiring a high order of intelligence and
discretion. Shortly after the Post Office had acquired the telegraphs,
it was compelled to extend the aforesaid policy to the new body
of State employees. As a matter of everyday politics, it proved
impossible for the Government to discriminate between the several
classes of public servants, paying one part of them &ldquo;fancy&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
wages, and the rest of them wages determined by demand and
supply.<a href="#Footnote_123_130" id="FNanchor_123_130" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>An episode from the reorganization of the Civil Service in 1876,
in accordance with the recommendation of the so-called Playfair
Commission, affords insight into the British practice of paying the
public servants something more than the market rate of wages and
salaries. The Playfair Commission had recommended that the pay of
the lower division of Government clerks begin with $325, and rise by
annual increments to $1,000, for seven hours&rsquo; work a day. Thereupon the
Government had fixed the rate at $400, to rise by annual increments to
$1,000. The Playfair Commission had stated that if it had been guided
by the &ldquo;voluminous&rdquo; evidence which it had taken, it would have fixed
at $750, the maximum to which should rise the salaries of the lower
division clerks. But it had desired to attract &ldquo;the elite&rdquo; of the
classes that the Government could draw from, and therefore it had fixed
the maximum at $1,000.<a href="#Footnote_124_131" id="FNanchor_124_131" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Fawcett Revision of Wages, 1881</em></div>

<p>In August, 1881, the House of Commons accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the proposal of Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, to increase the pay
of the telegraph operators, to count seven hours of night attendance
a day&rsquo;s work, and to grant various other minor concessions.<a href="#Footnote_125_132" id="FNanchor_125_132" class="fnanchor">125</a>
Those several changes raised the average sum spent for salaries
and wages in the transmission of a telegraphic message, from 11.70
cents in 1880-81, to 13.72 cents in 1884-85.<a href="#Footnote_126_133" id="FNanchor_126_133" class="fnanchor">126</a> Mr. Fawcett stated
in the House of Commons that inquiry of &ldquo;leading employees of labor,
such as bankers, railway companies, manufacturers, and others&rdquo; had led
him to conclude that the telegraph operators were underpaid. He also
mentioned the fact that while he was considering the arguments that
the telegraphists had made before him in support of the proposition
that their pay was inadequate, &ldquo;outside influence&rdquo; was brought to
bear repeatedly upon the telegraphists, and that the aforesaid
outside influence &ldquo;went so far as to recommend the employees to
resort to the last extremity of a strike.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_127_134" id="FNanchor_127_134" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>Mr. MacIver replied that &ldquo;he wished to say a word with regard to
the imputation contained in the statement of the Right Honorable
Gentleman, that he [Mr. MacIver] had exercised outside influence upon
the telegraphists. In common with other members of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
House, he had heard<a href="#Footnote_128_135" id="FNanchor_128_135" class="fnanchor">128</a> the complaints of the telegraphists, and had
thought it his duty to bring complaints before the House and the Right
Honorable Gentleman, the Postmaster General, so that, if he had erred,
he had erred in common with many others.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Treasury on Civil Service Pressure</em></div>

<p>In the course of the debate in the House of Commons, Lord Frederick
Cavendish, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: &ldquo;With respect to
the telegraph clerks, since they had received the franchise, they had
used it to apply pressure to Members of Parliament for the furtherance
of their own objects&hellip;. If, instead of the Executive being
responsible, Members of the House were to conduct the administration
of the departments, there would be an end of all responsibility
whatever. In the same way, if the Treasury was not to have control over
expenditure, and Members of the House were to become promoters of it,
the system [of administering the national finances] which had worked so
admirably in the past would be at an end&hellip;. With regard to the
position of the telegraphists in the Government Service as compared
with their former position under private companies, what had taken
place would be a warning to the Government to be careful against unduly
extending the sphere of their operations by entering every day upon
some new field, and placing themselves at a disadvantage by undertaking
the work of private persons. He pointed out that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Government Service was always more highly paid than that of the
companies and private persons, and in the particular case of the
telegraph clerks [operators] the men themselves received higher pay
than they had before.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_129_136" id="FNanchor_129_136" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Before the Postmaster General had introduced into Parliament his
scheme for improving the positions of the telegraphists, sorting
clerks and postmen,<a href="#Footnote_130_137" id="FNanchor_130_137"
class="fnanchor">130</a> Lord Frederick Cavendish, in his position
as Financial Secretary of the Treasury,<a href="#Footnote_131_138"
id="FNanchor_131_138" class="fnanchor">131</a> had written the
Postmaster General as follows: &ldquo;&hellip;Admitting, as my Lords
[of the Treasury] do, that when discontent is shown to prevail
extensively in any branch of the Public Service, it calls for attention
and inquiry, and, so far as it is proved to be well founded, for
redress, they are not prepared to acquiesce in any organized agitation
which openly seeks to bring its extensive voting power to bear on the
House of Commons against the Executive Government responsible for
conducting in detail the administration of the country. The persons who
are affected by the change now proposed are, as you observe, no fewer
than 10,000, and the entire postal service numbers nearly five times
as many. Other branches of the Civil Service employed and voting in
various parts of the United Kingdom, are at least as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
numerous in the aggregate as the servants of the Post Office. All this
vast number of persons, not living like soldiers and sailors outside
ordinary civil life are individually and collectively interested
in using their votes to increase, in their own favor, the public
expenditure, which the rest of the community, who have to gain their
living in the unrestricted competition of the open market, must
provide by taxation, if it is provided at all. My Lords therefore
reserve to themselves the power of directing that the execution of
the terms agreed to in the preceding part of the letter be suspended
in any post office of which the members are henceforth known to be
taking part in extra-official agitation. They understand that you are
inquiring whether the law, as declared in the existing Post Office
Acts, does not afford to the public similar protection in respect of
postal communication, including telegraphs, as is afforded by the Act
38 and 39 Victoria, c. 86, s. 4, to municipal authorities and other
contractors, against breaches of contracts of service in respect of
gas or water, the wilful interruption to the use of which [by means
of a strike] is hardly of more serious import to the local community
than is that of postal communications to the national community. If
the existing Post Office Acts do not meet this case, it will be for
my Lords to consider whether the circumstances continue to be such
as to make it their duty to propose to Parliament an extension to
the Post Office of provisions similar to those cited above from
the Act 38 and 39 Victoria, c. 86, s. 4.&rdquo;<a

<p>In June, 1882, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, said in the House
of Commons: &ldquo;The House would remember how, last session, he was
pressed by honorable Members on both sides of the House to increase
the pay of the telegraph employees &hellip; in spite of all that was
done for the telegraph employees, he noticed that they were constantly
saying that what they received was worse than nothing. All he could say
was that if $400,000<a href="#Footnote_133_140" id="FNanchor_133_140"
class="fnanchor">133</a> a year out of public funds was worse
than nothing, he, for one, deeply regretted that that sacrifice
of public money was ever made.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_134_141"
id="FNanchor_134_141" class="fnanchor">134</a> In March, 1883, Mr.
Fawcett, Postmaster General, said: &ldquo;The salaries of the telegraph
employees have&mdash;I will not say by the pressure of the House,
but certainly with the approval of the House&mdash;been increased
[in 1881]. I do not regret that increase; I think the extra pay they
receive was due to them, and if I had not thought so, no number of
memorials would have induced me to recommend the Treasury to make
such a large sacrifice of revenue.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_135_142"
id="FNanchor_135_142" class="fnanchor">135</a> In April, 1884, Mr.
Fawcett, Postmaster General, said: &ldquo;$750,000 a year has been
spent [of late] in improving the position of the telegraphists and
letter sorters, and I say there never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
was an expenditure of public money which was more justifiable than
that. If we had yielded to mere popular demands and thrown away the
money we should deserve the severest censure; but I believe that if an
increase of wages had not been conceded, it would have been impossible
to carry on the administration of the Department; and I think there
is no economy so unwise as refusing to increase remuneration when
you are convinced that the circumstances of the case demand the
increase.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_136_143" id="FNanchor_136_143"
class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>In July, 1888, the following questions and answers passed between
the Chairman of the Select Committee on Revenue Departments Estimates,
and Sir S. A. Blackwood, Secretary to the Post Office. &ldquo;With
respect to the increase of salaries at the time when Mr. Fawcett
was Postmaster General, I presume that those recommendations of his
were founded upon recommendations addressed to him by the [permanent
officers of the] Department?&rdquo; &ldquo;I can hardly say that they
were. Mr. Fawcett held very strong views himself as to the propriety
of making an increase to the pay of the lower ranks of the Department,
and he carried out that arrangement.&rdquo; &ldquo;But the Department,
I take for granted, was not excluded from expressing an opinion
upon the subject?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly not. I became Secretary
at the time [1880] when Mr. Fawcett became Postmaster General.<a
href="#Footnote_137_144" id="FNanchor_137_144" class="fnanchor">137</a>
I never should have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
initiated such a movement, but I saw great force in many
of the reasons which Mr. Fawcett urged in favor of such an
increase; and, at any rate, the Department, as represented by
me, saw no reason to raise a serious opposition, if it were at
liberty to do so, to the Postmaster General&rsquo;s views and
determinations.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_138_145" id="FNanchor_138_145"
class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee, 1897, Mr. E. B. L. Hill,
&ldquo;practically commander-in-chief of the provincial postmen,&rdquo;
testified as follows upon that part of the Fawcett revision of 1882
that applied to the postal service proper. He said that previous to
1882 all the revisions of the wages of the postmen had been made on the
basis of demand and supply; but that the Fawcett revision had departed
from that policy.<a href="#Footnote_139_146" id="FNanchor_139_146"

   <em>Evidence, in 1888, as to Civil Service Pressure</em>
</div>

<p>The Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888, took up at some
length, the question of the pressure brought by the civil servants upon
the House of Commons for increases of wages and salaries. Before that
Commission, Sir Reginald E. Welby, who had entered the Treasury in
1856, had become Assistant Financial Secretary in 1880, and had been
made Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in 1885, testified that many
Members of the House of Commons had recently attended meetings of the
civil servants for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of endorsing the claims of the civil servants for increases of pay;
and that they had taken that action without having made a close
examination of the grounds upon which the civil servants had put
forward their claims. He added: &ldquo;It is utterly impossible for us
[the Treasury] to ignore these symptoms that make it very difficult to
keep within reasonable bounds the remuneration of such a body.&rdquo;
Thereupon one of the members of the Royal Commission said to Sir R.
Welby: &ldquo;&hellip;but are you not aware that there is a general
feeling throughout the country among the people who are employed by
private individuals and public bodies [other than the State], that
Government servants receive higher pay than they do, and that when
these persons are called upon to exercise the franchise they bring
pressure to bear upon their Members just the other way [<span lang="la"
xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, against the increase of government wages
and salaries]?&rdquo; Sir R. Welby replied: &ldquo;Of course, I have
no means of testing that. I am very glad to hear that Parliamentary
influence is not all in one direction. We do not see the proof of it at
the Treasury.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_140_147" id="FNanchor_140_147"
class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Sir Algernon E. West, Chairman Inland Revenue Commissioners,<a
href="#Footnote_141_148" id="FNanchor_141_148" class="fnanchor">141</a>
said he wished for a greater spirit of economy, &ldquo;not in the
offices so much as outside.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Thereupon the Chairman of the Royal Commission said: &ldquo;I do not
quite understand what you mean by outside.&rdquo; Sir Algernon E. West
replied: &ldquo;I say it with all possible deference, particularly
Parliament.&rdquo; To the further query: &ldquo;Has there been on
the part of Members of Parliament, an increase of intervention on
behalf either of the individual officers of the Inland Revenue or on
behalf of classes of the Inland Revenue since the enfranchisement in
1869?&rdquo; Sir A. West replied: &ldquo;A large increase on behalf
of classes, not of individuals&hellip;. I should like to add &hellip;
that I think last year the Lower Division clerks succeeded in getting
two hundred Members of Parliament to attend a meeting which was held
to protest against their grievances.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_142_149"
id="FNanchor_142_149" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>Sir Lyon Playfair, who had been Chairman of the Royal Commission
on the Civil Service, 1874 to 1876, and the author of the Playfair
Reorganization of the Civil Service, 1876, testified as follows
before the Royal Commission of 1888. &ldquo;Unfortunately Members of
Parliament yield to pressure a great deal too much in that direction,
and they are certainly pressing the Exchequer to increase the wages
and salaries of the employees of the Crown&hellip;. In a private
establishment a man looks after his own interests, and if a person came
to him and said: &lsquo;Now you must increase the salaries of these men
by $100 or $250 all round,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
he would say: &lsquo;You are an impertinent man, you have no business
to interfere,&rsquo; but you cannot say that to Members of Parliament,
and there is continual pressure from Members of Parliament to augment
the salaries of the civil servants.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_143_150"

<div class="sidenote"><em>Raikes Revision of 1890-91</em></div>

<p>With the increase of the number of telegraphic messages transmitted,
from 33,278,000 in 1884-85, to 62,403,000 in 1889-90, the average
sum spent on wages and salaries per message transmitted, fell from
13.72 cents in 1884-85, to 10.62 cents in 1889-90. In the following
year, 1890-91, Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General, inaugurated an
extensive scheme of increases in wages, reductions in the hours of
work, and other &ldquo;improvements in the condition&rdquo; of the
telegraph employees, that again raised to 12.28 cents per message in
1894-95, the average sum spent on wages and salaries. Mr. Raikes,
Postmaster General, raised the wages of the supervising staff, as
well as the wages of the rank and file;<a href="#Footnote_144_151"
id="FNanchor_144_151" class="fnanchor">144</a> he granted payment at
one and one-quarter rates for over time, granted payment at double
rates for all work done on Sunday, gave extra pay for work done on
Bank Holidays, and increased from half pay to full pay the sick-leave
allowance. The annual cost of those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
concessions Mr. Raikes estimated at $500,000 a year. The cost
of the concessions granted at the same time to the employees in
the postal branch of the Post Office Department, he estimated at
$535,000 a year.<a href="#Footnote_145_152" id="FNanchor_145_152"
class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>Mr. Raikes&rsquo; schemes were based largely upon the <cite>Report
of Committee of the Indoor Staff</cite>. That Report has not
been published; but in 1896, Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary
General Post Office, London, stated before the so-called Tweedmouth
Committee,<a href="#Footnote_146_153" id="FNanchor_146_153"
class="fnanchor">146</a> that the majority of the committee on the
Indoor Staff
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
had signed the Report because they believed that if the concessions
recommended in the Report were granted, &ldquo;that would be the end
of all agitation.&rdquo; Mr. Hill added: &ldquo;I remember myself
saying [to the Committee] whatever else happens, that will not happen.
Do not delude yourselves with the notion that the men will cease to
ask.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;Mr. Raikes&rsquo; improvements were
received with the greatest gratitude, and there were any number of
letters of thanks from the staff; but the ink was scarcely dry when the
demands began again, and they have been going on ever since, and will
go on&hellip;. There is, unfortunately, a growing habit among the main
body of Post Office servants to use their voting power at elections
to get higher pay for themselves, and it is well known that in
constituencies in which political parties are at all evenly balanced,
the Post Office servants can turn the election.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Earl Compton demands a Select
Committee</em></div>

<p>The Committee on the Indoor Staff appointed by Mr. Raikes in
March, 1890, had not had the approval of the rank and file of the
civil servants, nor had it had the approval of the representatives
of the civil servants in the House of Commons, on the ground that it
consisted of government officials, who were not responsible directly
to the voters. Therefore one of the leading representatives in the
House of Commons of the Post Office employees, Earl Compton,<a
href="#Footnote_147_154" id="FNanchor_147_154" class="fnanchor">147</a>
on April 15, 1890,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
had moved: &ldquo;That, in the opinion of the House, the present
position of the telegraphists in London and elsewhere is
unsatisfactory, and their just grievances require redress.&rdquo;<a
href="#Footnote_148_155" id="FNanchor_148_155" class="fnanchor">148</a>
In the course of his argument, Earl Compton said: &ldquo;Perhaps the
Right Honorable Gentleman [the Postmaster General] has been cramped [in
the administration of his department] by what is called officialism.
In that case, if the present motion is passed, the Right Honorable
Gentleman&rsquo;s hands will be strengthened [against his permanent
officials], and he will be able to redress the grievances which have
been brought under his attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baron F. de Rothschild followed Earl Compton, with the statement:
&ldquo;The Postmaster General may well say it is no business of ours
to interfere between the civil servants and himself, but here I would
venture to ask him whether the civil servants are not quite as much
our [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, the public&rsquo;s]
servants as they are those of the Postmaster General?&rdquo; Baron de
Rothschild went on to say that through an error made in the course
of the transmission of a telegram his betting agent had placed his
money on the wrong horse, causing him to lose a considerable sum of
money. Such mistakes would not occur if the telegraphists were better
paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir A. Borthwick regretted &ldquo;the increasing tendency to invoke
the direct interposition of Parliament between the Executive Government
and the Civil Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Postmaster General concluded his statement with the words:
&ldquo;I hope that after the statement which I have been able to make,
the House will recognize the claim of every Government that the House
shall not interfere with matters of Departmental administration,
except where it thinks fit to censure the Minister in charge. So long
as a Minister occupies his position at the head of a department, he
ought to be allowed to occupy it in his own way. I venture to hope
that the House will leave questions of this sort in the hands of
those who are directly and primarily responsible for them, in the
belief that grievances of the servants of any department are not
likely to lack careful consideration, and, I believe, just and fair
treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few months later, the Postmaster General made this statement in
the House of Commons: &ldquo;I wish to correct one misapprehension.
It is supposed that the position of the Government is that only the
market value should be paid for labor of this sort [the nonestablished
post office servants]. Those who sat in the Committee [of Supply]
will remember that I laid down a different doctrine the other day.
My own view is, that while the market value must be the governing
consideration, because we are not dealing with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
our own money, but with the money of the taxpayers, the taxpayers
would wish that, in applying that standard to those in the Public
Service, we should always bear in mind that a great Government should
treat its employees liberally.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_149_156"
id="FNanchor_149_156" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Earl Compton failed to carry his motion in 1890; and in the
following year he made another unsuccessful attempt, moving:
&ldquo;That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that a
Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the Administration of the
Post Office.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_150_157" id="FNanchor_150_157"
class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose, speaking against the motion, said: &ldquo;Questions
between capital and labor and between the Government and its employees
should not be influenced by motions in the House. We are all subjected
as Members of this House to all manner of whips from employees of
the Civil Service and the Post Office, and I know that when the
<em>status</em>of the Civil Service clerks was being settled some time
ago, there was, among Members generally, a feeling of disgust at the
telegrams and letters being received almost very minute from people
seeking to influence our votes on some particular question of interest
to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General, enumerated in detail the concessions
made to the telegraphists and letter sorters in 1890 and 1891, at a
cost of $1,035,000 a year, and added: &ldquo;and to all this, not one
single reference
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
has escaped those who have spoken.&rdquo; He concluded with the words:
&ldquo;It would never do if, in order to encourage the vaporings of
three or four of those gutter journals which disfigure the Metropolitan
Press, Members of this House were to make the grave mistake of throwing
discredit upon a body of men like the permanent officials [Executive
Officers] of the Post Office, of whom any country might be proud,
with whom, I believe, any Minister would be delighted to work, and of
diminishing the authority in his own Department of a Minister, who,
whatever may be his personal deficiencies, at heart believes that he
has done nothing to forfeit the confidence of this House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few months later, when the House was considering the Estimates
of the Post Office Department, the Postmaster General said:
&ldquo;Economists [advocates of economy] of former days would have been
interested and surprised by the general tenor of the debate to which
we have just listened. The great point used to be, as I understand, to
show a large balance of revenue to the State [from the Post Office],
and to make a defense against charges of extravagance in the past. But
we have now arrived at a time when the opposite course is to be taken,
and the only chance a Minister has of enjoying the confidence of this
House is to point to a diminished balance of revenue and to a greater
expenditure on the part of the department&hellip;.&rdquo; In 1891-92
our telegraph expenditure will increase by $3,000,000, while our
revenue will increase by $1,700,000;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
&ldquo;the reason is to be found in the very comprehensive measures
framed in the course of the last year for the improvement of
the position of the staff.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_151_158"

   <em>Civil Servants circularize Members of Parliament</em>
</div>

<p>Mr. Raikes died in August, 1891; and in June, 1892, Sir James
Fergusson, his successor, asked the House of Commons to permit him
to call attention to a circular addressed to Candidates at the
[impending] General Election, and also sent to Members of the [present]
House. The circular had been issued by &ldquo;The Provincial Postal
Telegraph Male Clerks&rdquo; to &ldquo;Candidates at the General
Election,&rdquo; and contained the following statement: &ldquo;We have,
in addition, to ask you whether you will, if elected, vote for the
appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to inquire into the working
of the Telegraph Service, as we believe such an investigation would
be of great utility, and could not but tend to the improvement of the
service, the state of which is causing great public dissatisfaction, as
will be seen from the subjoined newspaper extracts. In conclusion, we
beg to state that we await your reply to these few questions of vital
importance with considerable anxiety, and trust that you will give them
your careful consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir James Fergusson added that another branch of the Post Office
servants was issuing similar circulars.<a href="#Footnote_152_159"
id="FNanchor_152_159" class="fnanchor">152</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
He said, &ldquo;I think that there would be an end to the
discipline which should characterize members of the Public Service
if encouragement were given to such attempts to bring pressure
to bear on Members of the House and Candidates on the eve of a
General Election&hellip;. I have to say that the leading Members
of the Opposition, including the right honorable Member for
Midlothian [Mr. W. E. Gladstone], and the right honorable Member
for Derby [Sir Wm. Harcourt], fully concur in the observations I
have made.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_153_160" id="FNanchor_153_160"
class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>A few days later, the Postmaster General issued the following
notice: &ldquo;The Postmaster General at the same time warns Post
Office servants that it would be improper for them, in combination
or individually, to endeavor to extract promises from any candidate
for election to the House of Commons with reference to their pay or
duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the House of Commons Sir James Fergusson defended this notice
in these words: &ldquo;I in no way deny the right of Members of the
Public Service to appeal to Members of this House to get their case
represented here, but there is all the difference between Members being
asked to represent a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span>
case, and candidates being asked to pledge themselves upon an ex-parte
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
statement to support a revision [of wages and salaries] or a
commission of inquiry&mdash;in fact, to prejudge the case. To ask
for such a promise as a condition of giving a vote does seem to me
inconsistent with the duties of a public servant, and to go beyond
his constitutional privileges. In that view the warning has been
issued. By what law or right has this been done, the honorable Member
asks? By the right and duty which belongs to the head of a Department
to preserve proper discipline.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_154_161"

<p>In August, 1892, the Salisbury Government was succeeded by the
Gladstone Government, and Mr. Arnold Morley became Postmaster General.
On August 28, 1893, Mr. W. E. Gladstone, First Lord of the Treasury,
in reply to a question from Mr. Macdonald, said: &ldquo;Questions may
be raised, on which I have no judgment to give on the part of the
Government, as to how far, for example, it is desirable for the public
functionaries to make use of their position as voters for the purpose
of obtaining from candidates promises or engagements tending directly
to the advantage of public servants in respect of pay and promotion.
These are matters which we deem not undeserving of consideration; but
still they do not form the subject of any decision on the part of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Government in the nature of a restraint.&rdquo;<a

In accordance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with the policy thus announced, the Gladstone Ministry
rescinded Sir James Fergusson&rsquo;s order of June 17,

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Macdonald demands a Select

<p>In September, 1893, while the House was in Committee of Supply,
Mr. Macdonald<a href="#Footnote_157_164" id="FNanchor_157_164"
class="fnanchor">157</a> moved &ldquo;a reduction of $500 in respect of
the Salary of the Postmaster General&rdquo;, in order to bring before
the committee the demand of the Post Office employees for &ldquo;an
independent inquiry by a Parliamentary Committee.&rdquo; He stated
&ldquo;that in 1891 the present Postmaster General [Mr. Arnold Morley]
voted in favor of an inquiry such as that for which he [Mr. Macdonald]
now asked, and he wished to know whether anything had occurred
to cause the Right Honorable Gentleman to change his view since
that time.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_158_165" id="FNanchor_158_165"
class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>The Postmaster General, Mr. Morley, replied: &ldquo;He was asked
how he could account for his vote in 1891 when he had supported the
Motion of the noble Earl, the Member for Barnsley [Earl Compton]? He
accounted for it on two grounds: He had supported the proposal, which
was an unprecedented one, because there was an unprecedented condition
of discontent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
prevailing throughout the Postal and Telegraph Service&mdash;or, he
confessed, he was under that impression at the time. The condition of
things in various branches of the Service was serious. There had been
an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;meute</span> in the Savings
Bank Department, and whether with reason or without reason, the whole
of the Services were discontented with their position. The condition
of things at present, however, did not bear out the idea that there
was anything like general discontent prevailing. He accounted for his
action on another ground. Since 1891 large concessions had been made,
with enormous additional expense to the country, and that made the
state of things very different to what it was when he supported the
noble Earl&rsquo;s Motion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earl Compton said: &ldquo;He had several times in past years stood
up and spoken for the telegraph clerks, and as the Amendment before
the committee related practically to them, it would be dishonest and
mean on his part, if, having taken a strong course [while sitting] in
opposition, he did not take the same course now his friends were in
power.&rdquo;</p>

that the most serious grievance alleged by the Post Office employees
was inadequacy of pay arising from stagnation of promotion. It was true
that at the time the blocking extended only to the more highly paid
portions of the rank and file, but it must soon extend to the general
body of employees unless relief were afforded. In 1880, and in 1890,
Parliament had sanctioned respectively the Fawcett revision of wages,
and the Raikes revision, for the purpose of correcting inadequacies of
pay arising from stagnation of promotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
The employees now demanded the abolition of the classes into which were
divided the various grades of the rank and file of the Post Office
employees; they demanded assured promotion to a definite maximum wage
or salary.</p>

<p>That demand rested on the assumption that the employees
had a vested right to the rate of promotion that had obtained
under the extraordinary increase of telegraphic business that
had followed the transfer of the telegraphs to the State in
1870, and had followed the adoption of the 12 cent tariff in
October, 1885.<a href="#Footnote_162_169" id="FNanchor_162_169"
class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kearley supported his argument by reference to the
telegraphists, who enter the service between the ages of fourteen and
eighteen, as second class telegraphists, and in the course of fourteen
years rise by annual increments from the wage of $3 a week to $10 a
week. At the latter wage they remain, unless they are promoted to be
first class telegraphists, whose wages rise by annual increments, from
$10 a week to $14 a week&mdash;payment for over-time, and so forth,
being excluded in all cases. Mr. Kearley argued that promotion from
the second class to the first class was blocked, stating that in
Birmingham, in the last 4&frac34;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
years, only 11 men in 168 had been promoted from second class
telegraphists to first class telegraphists; and that in Belfast and
Edinburgh the annual rate of promotion had been respectively 1.14 per
cent. and 2 per cent. Those instances, said the speaker, were typical
of the larger cities; the conditions in the smaller cities and in the
towns being still worse.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, replied to this part of
Mr. Kearley&rsquo;s argument with the statement that there were in London
and in the Provinces 3,308 second class male telegraphists, and
that out of that number only 65 were both eligible for promotion
and in receipt of the maximum wage of the second class, namely $10
a week. He added that the average wage of the men telegraphists who
had been promoted from the second class to the first in 1894 had
been $8.46. That meant that, on an average, the men in question
had been promoted three years before they had reached the maximum
wage of the second class. The Postmaster General characterized as
&ldquo;<del>extraordinarly</del><ins>extraordinarily</ins> misleading&rdquo; the
source from which Mr. Kearley had taken his statements of fact, namely,
a table in a pamphlet issued by the telegraphists in support of their
contention that promotion was blocked. The compilers of the table had
left out promotions &ldquo;due to causes other than what were termed ordinary
causes, namely promotions due to appointments to postmasterships and
chief clerkships, to transfers from provincial offices to the central
office in London, and to reductions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
officers on account of misconduct.&rdquo; Thus at Birmingham there had been,
not 11 promotions, but 16; at Liverpool, not 8, but 37; at Belfast, not
4, but 14; at Newcastle, not 5, but 24; at Bristol, not 6, but 13; at
Southampton, not 2, but 8.</p>

<p>The second alleged grievance brought forward by Mr. Kearley
related to the so-called auxiliary staff, which consisted of men who
supplemented their earnings in private employment by working for the
Post Office in the mail branch. It was stated that the Post Office
was paying the auxiliary staff from $3.75 to $4.00 a week, whereas it
should pay at least $6.00 a week. The third grievance related to the
so-called split duties, which involved in the course of the 24 hours of
the day more than one attendance at the office. The abolition of those
duties was demanded. The fourth grievance was that some of the younger
employees were obliged to take their annual three weeks&rsquo; vacation [on
full pay] in the months of November to February.</p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit,<a href="#Footnote_163_170" id="FNanchor_163_170"
class="fnanchor">163</a> in seconding the motion, termed
&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; the demand of the telegraphists that the wages
of the London telegraphists should rise automatically to $1,150 a year;
and those of the provincial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
telegraphists to $1,000 a year. At the time the maximum wage attainable
in London was $950, while the maximum attainable in the provinces
was $800. Sir Albert Rollit added that the recent order of the Post
Office that first class telegraphists must pass certain technical
examinations or forego further promotion and further increments in pay,
&ldquo;amounted almost to tyranny,&rdquo; and he further reflected
that &ldquo;where law ended, tyranny began.&rdquo; Sir Albert Rollit,
an eminent merchant and capitalist, contended that when the existing
body of telegraphists had entered the service, no knowledge of the
technics of telegraphy had been required, and that therefore it would
be a breach of contract to require the present staff to acquire such
knowledge unless it were specifically paid for going to the trouble of
acquiring such knowledge. That contention of Sir Albert Rollit was but
one of many instances of the extraordinary doctrine of &ldquo;vested
rights&rdquo; developed by the British Civil Service, and recognized by
the British Government, namely, that the State may make no changes in
the terms and conditions of employment, unless it shall indemnify by
money payments the persons affected by the changes. If the State shall
be unwilling to make such indemnification, the changes in the terms
and conditions of employment must be made to apply only to persons who
shall enter the service in the future; they may not be made to apply to
those already in the service. This doctrine is supported in the House
of Commons by eminent merchants,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
manufacturers and capitalists. Sir Albert K. Rollit, for instance,
is a steamship owner at Hull, Newcastle and London; a Director of
the National Telephone Company, and he has held for six years and
five years respectively the positions of President of the Associated
Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom and President of the London
Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>When Sir Albert Rollit argued that the Government had broken
faith with the telegraphers, those public servants, acting under
instructions from their leaders, were neglecting to avail themselves
of their opportunities to learn the elementary scientific principles
underlying telegraphy, and were even repudiating the obligation
to acquire knowledge of those principles. The state of affairs
was such that the Engineer-in-Chief of the Telegraphs, Mr. W. H.
Preece, began to fear that before long he would be unable to fill
the positions requiring an elementary knowledge of the technics
of telegraphy.<a href="#Footnote_164_171" id="FNanchor_164_171"
class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Mr. Arnold Morley, Postmaster General, began his reply to Mr.
Kearley&rsquo;s Motion with the statement that &ldquo;he understood the
mover of the Motion spoke on behalf of those in the Post Office service
who had taken an active part in the promoting what he might call an
agitation, and that his [Mr. Kearley&rsquo;s] position was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
that, in the condition of feeling in the service, some steps ought
to be taken which would enable the real facts to be brought not
only before the public, but before Parliament&hellip;.&rdquo; He
[Mr. Morley] had made a careful examination of most of the alleged
grievances during the three years he had been at the Post Office, and
though he had satisfied himself that in the main they were not well
founded, he recognized that a very strong feeling existed not only
among a portion of the staff, but also among the public, and among
Members of the House.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Civil Servants&rsquo; Campaign of Education</em>
</div>

<p>The feeling in question the Postmaster General attributed largely to
the manner in which the case of the telegraphists had been presented
by the telegraphists in the House of Commons, and in the newspaper
press. He spoke of the &ldquo;extraordinarily misleading&rdquo; table
of promotions published by the telegraphists. He then went on to
state that recently the Postmaster at Bristol had reorganized the
local telegraph office. By reducing the amount of over-time work,
and by abolishing four junior offices, he had effected a saving of
$3,000 to $3,500 a year. Thereupon a local newspaper had come out
with the heading: &ldquo;A Premium on Sweating;&rdquo; and had made
the statement, which was not true, that the local Postmaster had
received a premium of $500 for effecting a saving of $3,800 at the
expense of the staff.<a href="#Footnote_165_172" id="FNanchor_165_172"
class="fnanchor">165</a> Mr. Morley continued with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the statement that in June, 1894, a deputation from the London Trades
Council had complained to the Postmaster General that skilled electric
light men were often employed by the Post Office at laborer&rsquo;s
wages at its factory at Holloway, citing the case of one Turner.
Upon inquiry the Postmaster General had learned that Turner had been
employed as a wireman, had been &ldquo;discharged from slackness of
work,&rdquo; and, upon his own request in writing, had been taken back
&ldquo;out of kindness&rdquo; as a laborer. The same deputation had
mentioned the case of one Harrison, alleged to be earning on piece
work, at the Holloway Factory, $1.75, $2.25, and $3.75 a week. On
inquiry the Postmaster had ascertained that Harrison was able to earn
$10 a week and more, but that &ldquo;for the purpose of agitation, he
had deliberately lowered the amount of his wages by abstaining from
doing full work.&rdquo; After the Postmaster General had informed
the London Trades Council of the facts of the case, that body had
passed resolutions denouncing the postal authorities at the Holloway
Factories. Again, Mr. Churchfield, Secretary of the Postmen&rsquo;s
Federation, in an interview with the representative of a London
newspaper had stated that the shortest time worked by the men on split
duties was 12&frac34; hours, while the longest was 22 hours [in the
course of one day and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
night]. A duty of seven hours lasting from 8 p. m. to 10 p. m., and
from 12 p. m. to 5 a. m., Mr. Churchfield had called a continuous duty
of twenty-two hours, lasting from 12 p. m. to 10 p. m. The public
also was &ldquo;grossly misled&rdquo; as to the condition of the
auxiliary postmen. For example, one Mears was alleged to earn, after 27
years&rsquo; service, only $3 a week. Inquiry showed that Mears worked
in a warehouse during the day, and received from the Post Office $3 a
week for duties performed between the hours of 6 p. m. and 10 p. m.
Other cases had been reported, but in not one instance had the figures
been correct. One man in receipt of $3.94 a week, had been put down at
$2.62. The London auxiliary postmen received from 12 cents to 18 cents
an hour; they were mainly small tradesmen, shop assistants, and private
watchmen. In the country, the auxiliary postmen received from 8 cents
to 10 cents an hour.</p>

<p>The Postmaster General continued with the statement that the
increases in wages and the concessions granted by Mr. Fawcett and Mr.
Raikes had augmented the combined expenditures of the postal branch
and telegraph branch by $3,750,000 a year.<a href="#Footnote_166_173"
id="FNanchor_166_173" class="fnanchor">166</a> &ldquo;In 1881, the
wages formed 48.7 per cent. of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
gross expenditure, whereas now they formed 59.9 per cent&hellip;. He
did not think that he need add to those figures, except to say that
in addition to salaries there were a large number of allowances for
special duties. In the circulation office in London were 4,000 sorters,
of whom 250 had each an allowance of $2.50 a week, while a very large
number had allowances of $1.25, $0.75 and $0.50, of which never a word
was said when complaints were made about salaries.&rdquo; The demands
made by the telegraphists would increase the State&rsquo;s expenditures
by $3,250,000 a year, &ldquo;taking into account the consequential
advances which other classes in the Public Service, treated on the same
footing, would naturally receive.&rdquo; Similarly, the letter sorters
made an application involving a direct increase of $635,000, and an
indirect increase of another $2,500,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Morley next recited some statistics to show, &ldquo;first
of all, the desire among people outside to come into the Post
Office Service, and secondly, the disinclination of those inside
to go out.&rdquo; The Post Office recently had called for 650 male
letter sorters, and had received 1,506 applications. A call for 188
&ldquo;telegraph learners,&rdquo; had brought out 2,486 candidates. In
London, in 1894, there had been no resignations among 1,261 first class
sorters, and 23 resignations among 2,958 second class sorters. Out
of 5,000 London postmen, 19 had resigned in 1894; and in the 5 years
ending with 1894, a total of 5,700 telegraphists had furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
348 resignations, including the resignations of women who left
the service in order to marry.<a href="#Footnote_167_174"
id="FNanchor_167_174" class="fnanchor">167</a> &ldquo;He could not
help thinking that when the working men got to know to the full extent
the terms and prospects of Postal Service, the sympathy which they
had so freely bestowed on Post Office employees would be largely
withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Government compromises with the Civil Servants</em>
</div>

<p>Mr. Morley, Postmaster General, summed up with the statement that
&ldquo;he should be the last to deny that change and amelioration might
be required in certain respects, but, having examined all the cases, he
believed the men of the Postal Service, the Telegraph Staff as well as
the Postal Staff, were better treated than people from the same class
in private employment. But that opinion was not altogether shared by
the public, or by certain Members of the House of Commons, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
therefore the Government was prepared to appoint a strong Committee,
composed of men who would have special and practical knowledge and
experience of administration, and who would, he hoped, be assisted by
a Member of the Labor Department of the Board of Trade&hellip;. There
must be upon the Committee one official of the Post Office in order to
assist the Committee, but apart from that one appointment, he proposed
that the Committee should be appointed from executive officers of the
Government not connected with the Post Office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir James Fergusson, who had preceded Mr. Morley as Postmaster
General, said: &ldquo;He could not shut his eyes to the fact that there
was no difficulty whatever in finding candidates for employment in the
Post Office. In fact, it was impossible to meet the wishes of many of
those who desired to enter the Department. In those circumstances he
thought it could hardly be contended seriously that the remuneration
offered was grossly inadequate, or that the conditions of service were
unduly onerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The House of Commons accepted the compromise offered by the
Government. Lord Tweedmouth, Lord Privy Seal and a Member of the
Cabinet, was made Chairman of the Committee, which consisted, in
addition, of Sir F. Mowatt, Permanent Secretary of the Treasury; Sir
A. Godley, Under Secretary of State for India; Mr. Spencer Walpole,
Permanent Secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to the Post Office; and Mr. Llewellyn Smith, of the Labor Department of
the Board of Trade.<a href="#Footnote_168_175" id="FNanchor_168_175"

     CHAPTER X <br /><span class="smcap">The Tweedmouth Committee
     Report</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The Government accepts all recommendations made by the
   Committee. Sir Albert K. Rollit, one of the principal
   champions in the House of Commons of the postal employees,
   immediately follows with a motion &ldquo;intended to reflect
   upon the Report of the Tweedmouth Committee.&rdquo; Mr. Hanbury,
   Financial Secretary to the Treasury, intimates that it
   may become necessary to disfranchise the civil servants.
   The Treasury accepts the recommendations of the so-called
   Norfolk-Hanbury Committee. The average of expenses on account
   of wages and salaries rises from 11.54 cents per telegram
   in 1895-96, to 13.02 cents in 1902-03, concomitantly with
   an increase in the number of telegrams from 79,423,000 to
   92,471,000.</p>
</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter the narrative was brought down to the
appointment in 1895, of the so-called Tweedmouth Committee.<a href="#Footnote_169_176" id="FNanchor_169_176" class="fnanchor">169</a>
That Committee consisted of Lord Tweedmouth, Lord Privy Seal and a
Member of the Cabinet; Sir F. Mowatt, Permanent Secretary of the
Treasury; Sir A. Godley, Under Secretary of State for India; Mr. Spence
Walpole, Permanent Secretary of the Post Office; and Mr. Llewellyn
Smith, of the Labor Department of the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Terms of Reference to the Committee on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Post Office Establishments,&rdquo; the Postmaster General included this
paragraph: &ldquo;In conducting this inquiry, I can have no doubt you will
recollect that the Post Office is a great Revenue Department; and
that, in the words of the <cite>Select Committee on Revenue Departments
Estimates</cite> in 1888, it &lsquo;is most likely to continue to be conducted
satisfactorily, if it should also continue to be conducted with
a view to profit, as one of the Revenue yielding Departments of
the State.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_170_177" id="FNanchor_170_177" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>No Service like the Public Service</em></div>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee Mr. Lewin Hill, who, as Assistant
Secretary General Post Office, was the executive officer who had
general charge of all the postal and telegraph employees outside of
London, testified as follows: &ldquo;My own view is that the time has come
for telling the postmen, in common with the members of the rest of the
manipulative staff [the telegraphists] in answer to their demand for
a general rise of wages, that the Post Office Department is satisfied
that the wages already paid are in excess of the market value of their
services; that this being so, no general addition to pay will be
given, and that if the staff are dissatisfied, and can do better for
themselves outside the Post Office, they are, as they know, at perfect
liberty to seek employment elsewhere.&rdquo; The Chairman, Lord Tweedmouth,
asked Mr. Hill: &ldquo;Do you think there is any other particular class of
employment which is comparable with that of the postmen [and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
telegraphists]?&rdquo; Mr. Hill replied: &ldquo;I thought of railway servants,
whose work in many ways resembles the work of our employees. If they
have not the same permanence [of tenure] as our own people have,
they have continuous employment so long as they are efficient, but
our people have continuous employment whether they are efficient or
not&hellip;. In that respect all of us in the Postal Service stand in
a unique position, from top to bottom our men are certain as long as
they conduct themselves reasonably well to retain their maximum pay
down to the last day they remain in the Service, and whatever their
class may be, whether postmen, or sorting clerks, or telegraphists,
or officers of higher grade, they continue, failing misconduct, to
rise to the maximum pay of their class, quite regardless of whether
they are worth the higher pay that they get from year to year.&rdquo; The
only concession that Mr. Hill was willing to recommend was, that in
the larger towns the time required for postmen and telegraphists to
rise from the minimum scale of pay to the maximum be reduced from 13
years to 6 years.<a href="#Footnote_171_178" id="FNanchor_171_178" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Badcock, Controller of the Metropolitan Postal Service
other than the Service in the London Central Post Office, and Mr. H. C.
Fischer, Controller of the London Central Post Office, joined in Mr.
Lewin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Hill&rsquo;s recommendation. Mr. Fischer added that the London telegraphists
should be given better chances of passing from the second class to the
first class than they had enjoyed in the last three or four years,<a href="#Footnote_172_179" id="FNanchor_172_179" class="fnanchor">172</a>
and that the pay of the London senior telegraphists, who were a kind of
assistants to the assistant superintendents, ought to be raised above
the existing scale of $950.</p>

<p>Mr. C. H. Kerry, Postmaster at Stoke-on-Trent, stated that if the
Post Office Department &ldquo;was willing to act, not only the part of the
model employer, but of an exceptionally liberal employer; and it was
thought after all that had been done for the staff so recently, that
still a little further should be done,&rdquo; the Department might reduce
from 13 years to 5 years the period that it took the rank and file to
pass from the minimum salary of their class to the maximum salary. But
there was no necessity of doing anything for any one, &ldquo;on a general
consideration of the pay given elsewhere to persons performing duties
requiring about the same amount of intelligence.&rdquo; There was &ldquo;absolutely
no justification&rdquo; for increasing the existing maximum of pay.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerry had entered the Post Office telegraph service in 1870,
after having served with the Electric and International Company from
1854 to 1870. He said: &ldquo;The speed at which the telegraphists had to work
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
present, that is the speed per man,<a href="#Footnote_173_180" id="FNanchor_173_180" class="fnanchor">173</a> because the
telegraph companies kept only enough force for the minimum work,
and when the work increased you had to catch that up by increased
effort&hellip;. As a previous witness said, one of the laws of the
service is that there must be no delay, but I think there is a well
understood law, also, that there must be no confusion, and the
arrangements made are now such that the maximum of work, as a rule,
can be dealt with without undue pressure&hellip;. From 1870 to 1889,
I was constantly in the Telegraph branch and witnessing from day to
day, and almost from hour to hour, the work which the telegraphists
performed&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_174_181" id="FNanchor_174_181" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>This testimony from Mr. Kerry must be borne in mind when reading the
complaints of the Post Office telegraphists that the salaries paid by
the Eastern Telegraph [Cable] Company rise to $1,020 a year, whereas
the salaries of first class telegraphists in London rise only to $950.
The employees of the Eastern Telegraph Company have to work under so
much greater pressure than the State telegraphists, that Mr. Fischer,
Controller of the London Central Telegraph Office, was able to state:
&ldquo;I have never known a telegraphist in the first class to leave our
service for that of any of the [Cable] companies. The cable companies
draw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
very few men from us, and those drawn away as a rule, are young
men in the second class who are receiving about $250 or $300,
and are attracted by the prospect of an immediate increase
of some $150 upon entrance into the service of the cable
companies.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_175_182" id="FNanchor_175_182" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Tweed&shy;mouth Commit&shy;tee&rsquo;s Recommen&shy;dations</em></div>

<p>Those telegraph offices which are not sufficiently important to
justify the employment of telegraphists of the first class, are divided
into four groups: B, C, D and E. The Tweedmouth Committee recommended
that the maximum salary of the telegraphists in the offices of Group
E be raised from $8 a week to $8.50: in offices of group D from
$8.75 to $9; in offices of group C from $9.50 to $10; and in offices
of group B from $10 to $11. It recommended furthermore that all
provincial telegraphists should rise automatically and without regard
to efficiency, to a salary of not less than $10 a week. Beyond $10 they
should not go, unless fully competent. The Committee added that it
placed &ldquo;the efficiency bar at the high figure of $10 a week,<a
href="#Footnote_176_183" id="FNanchor_176_183" class="fnanchor">176</a>
for the special reason that it may be rigorously enforced,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and that all inducements to treat it as a matter of form, liable to be
abrogated for the reason of compassion, may be removed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the telegraphists employed in Metropolitan London, the
Tweedmouth Committee recommended that all telegraphists should rise
at least to &ldquo;the efficiency bar&rdquo; of $560 a year; and that
those who could pass the efficiency bar, should rise automatically
to $800, the maximum salary of first class telegraphists. In the
past, telegraphists in London had been promoted from the second
class to the first class, only upon the occurrence of vacancies.
In this case, also, the Committee added to its recommendation the
words: &ldquo;This efficiency bar has been placed at the high
figure of $560 for the special reason that it may be rigorously
enforced, and that all inducements to treat it as a matter of
form, liable to be abrogated for reasons of compassion, may be
removed.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_177_184" id="FNanchor_177_184"
class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>These recommendations the Tweedmouth Committee made in order to meet
the complaints advanced by the Post Office employees that the falling
off in the rate of increase of the business of the telegraph branch had
caused a slackening in the flow of promotion.</p>

<p>The remaining recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee it is not
necessary to enumerate; suffice it to say, that the Postmaster General,
the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of Norfolk, advised the Government to accept all of the
Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, with the statement that, on the basis
of the staff of 1897, the cost of carrying out the recommendations
would begin with $695,000 a year, and would rise ultimately to
$1,375,000. That estimate related to both branches of the Post Office,
the postal branch and the telegraph; no separate estimates were made
for the several branches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>The Government accepts the Committee&rsquo;s
Recom&shy;menda&shy;tions</em></div>

<p>The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury accepted the
Postmaster General&rsquo;s recommendations, and directed the Financial
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, to write as follows to
the Postmaster General.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has, of course, been necessary for my Lords to consider
very carefully proposals involving so large an increase of expenditure
in a single Department at one time, and they have duly weighed the
reasons which the Committee adduces in support of its conclusions.
While many of the proposals appear to be abundantly justified by the
considerations put forward, there are others which my Lords would have
hesitated to accept on any authority less entitled to respect than
that by which they are supported. But, my Lords readily acknowledge
the exceptional competence of the Committee to pronounce a judgment
on the question which came before it, and the great care with which
the inquiry has been conducted. They also note that the conclusions
represent the unanimous opinion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Committee, and that they are, in all cases, endorsed by your Grace.
They have therefore decided, in view of the weight of authority by
which your recommendations are supported, to accept them as they stand,
and they authorize you to give effect to them as from the first of
April next. They have adopted this course from a strong desire to do
full justice to one of the largest and most important services of the
State, and because they feel that the settlement now effected must be
accepted as permanently satisfying all reasonable claims on the part
of the classes included in its terms. The only condition which my
Lords desire to attach to their acceptance of your proposals is that
the annual increments of pay should, in all cases, be dependent on the
certificate of a superior officer, that the conduct of the recipient
during the preceding year has been satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>Sir A. K. Rollit demands a Committee of
Business Men</em></div>

<p>The recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee went into effect
on April 1, 1897. On July 16, 1897, while the House of Commons was in
Committee of Supply, Sir Albert K. Rollit moved the reduction of the
salary of the Postmaster General by $5,000.<a href="#Footnote_178_185"
id="FNanchor_178_185" class="fnanchor">178</a> Sir Albert Rollit said:
&ldquo;The Amendment was intended to reflect upon the report of the
Tweedmouth Committee, rather than upon either the Government or the
Post Office Department, for he thought more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
might be done to remedy the abuses which were known [shown?] to exist
in the course of the report itself. To speak of the Post Office as a
revenue earning machine was, in his opinion, not a full or adequate
description. He shared to the full the opinion that its first object
was to give facilities to the public rather than merely to earn
profits, and also to do justice to its employees&hellip;. There were
grievances which had not been redressed by the report, and the House
had a great deal more to do in that direction. It was no answer to say
that the Treasury had appropriated a large sum of $695,000 for that
very purpose, for after all, what did the appropriation amount to?
It only amounted to a rectification of the inadequacies of the past.
It was not in London alone, but throughout the United Kingdom, that
something like chronic discontent existed. The complaints were loud and
widespread. He did not at all agree as to the propriety of the course
intimated [by the telegraphists] by way of notice to the Postmaster
General, that if the grievances were not redressed, over-time work
at night would be suspended [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span> the
telegraphists would refuse to work over-time in order to compel the
Government to redress their grievances]. That was an extreme remedy in
cases where the public convenience and service were concerned; but,
after all, every man&rsquo;s labor was his own right, and if there were
no disposition to remedy present grievances, even that extreme way of
trying to bring about a remedy might possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
have to be resorted to. The Treasury was, of course, a barrier to a
good deal. He did not say the heads of a Department did not value as
much as he might do pecuniarily the services of those who contributed
to the joint effect which he and they made for the public advantage,
and if we had a splendid Civil Service in this country, he thought it
had one great defect, and that was too glaring disproportion between
the salaries of the highest officials and those of the lower, and this
proportion might well be redressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit said he could not enumerate all the grievances,
he would have to confine himself to the enumeration of the worst
ones. He began by endorsing the contention of the telegraphists that
everybody should rise automatically to a salary of $1,000 a year. The
establishment of the &ldquo;efficiency bars&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
really a violation of the contract with the telegraph operators, and
was a grave and gross injustice to them.&rdquo; He maintained, also,
that the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation that the payment for Sunday
labor be reduced from double rates to a rate and a half was &ldquo;a
material alteration of the contract under which servants entered the
Department.&rdquo; He supported the contention of the State employees
that it was a grievance that some of the employees had to take their
annual vacation in the winter months. &ldquo;The postmen had asked that
the Christmas boxes [contributions from the public] be abolished, $26 a
year being added to the wages as a compromise. Evidence had been given
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that $1.25 a year was the real value of the Christmas boxes, but the
Committee said there should be no solicitation for Christmas boxes,
and no compensation for their loss.&rdquo; &ldquo;He hoped that a
statement of grievances, which were provoking the strongest possible
feeling, with disadvantage to the efficiency of the Post Office, would
be listened to. He was extremely glad to recognize that the Postmaster
General had been willing to receive two deputations&mdash;one on June
15, which had not yet been replied to, and one yesterday. But he would
urge upon the Department and the Government that the real remedy for
this strong and wide discontent was the appointment of an independent
Committee, because the decision of such a tribunal composed not of
officials, but of practical business men, who would perhaps have more
sympathy with men in the lower grades of the service, would be loyally
accepted, and thus the public would be advantaged and contentment
restored to a service which was of great value to the country.&rdquo;
[&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>Mr. R. W. Hanbury, who, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
represented in the House of Commons the Postmaster General, the Duke
of Norfolk, replied: &ldquo;that throughout the discussion some facts
had been more or less left out of sight. Honorable Members ought to
recollect, in the first place, that the Tweedmouth Committee gave
universal satisfaction when it was appointed. It was then agreed that
it was the right kind of Committee; and that the right kind of men
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
were appointed to serve upon it. There was no preponderance of Treasury
opinion upon the Committee. In fact, the only Treasury official sitting
upon it was Sir Francis Mowatt. There was on it a high representative
of the Post Office, and the officials of a Department were not as a
rule anxious to cut down the salaries of their subordinates. Their
tendency would rather be to recommend an increase in salaries. There
was also on the Committee a representative of the Labor Department
of the Board of Trade, who was particularly well qualified to give
an opinion as to the proportion which the wages of the postal and
telegraph employees bore to the wages of persons doing corresponding
work outside the Post Office. Therefore the Committee was a very
efficient body, and through its recommendations the salaries of the
officials had already been increased by $700,000 a year, and the
increase would amount to something like $1,250,000 a year in the next
few years. The Treasury had accepted every recommendation of the
Committee, whose suggestions had been adopted wholesale. There was no
ground for complaint, therefore, in that direction.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"> <em>Disfranchisement of Civil Servants
Suggested</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;Another fact which Members ought not to overlook was the
political pressure which was far too frequently exercised by Civil
Servants upon those who also represented them.&rdquo; [&ldquo;Hear,
hear.&rdquo;] &ldquo;That was a great and growing danger. It was
chiefly in London that this pressure was brought to bear&hellip;. He
would give an instance of the way in which these Civil
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Servants spoke of the expediency of political pressure. At one of the
great meetings which had been held, a speaker said there were 8,000
postmen in London, and that he hoped every one would have his name
upon the register [of voters], so that at election times they could
exercise their influence upon candidates and advocate the cause of
higher wages. He was of the opinion that political pressure ought not
to be brought to bear in that way.&rdquo; [&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;]
&ldquo;Ordinary workmen could not exercise the same power, but Civil
Servants could, and, whether their agitation succeeded or not, their
position was secure, so that it was a case of &lsquo;Heads, I win;
tails, I don&rsquo;t lose&rsquo;&hellip;. Before the Royal Commission
[of 1888], which had inquired into the Civil Service establishments,
evidence was given with regard to the way in which pressure was brought
to bear in certain constituencies upon Members, and he thought that
the almost unanimous feeling of the Commission was that, if this state
of things continued, it would be necessary to disfranchise the Civil
Service.&rdquo; [&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;]<a href="#Footnote_179_186"
id="FNanchor_179_186" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit replied: &ldquo;They had to acknowledge a very
sympathetic speech from the Secretary to the Treasury. Perhaps if
some honorable Members went to the Treasury in regard to this matter,
accompanied by one person who might represent practically the views
which were entertained by those concerned, the matter might be further
gone into. He begged leave to withdraw his Amendment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Secretary to the Treasury replied: &ldquo;There was no objection
on the part of the Treasury to hearing communications from Members of
Parliament on the subject, but with regard to officials of the Post
Office coming to the Treasury, he should not like to give any pledge
without first consulting with the Postmaster General.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Norfolk-Hanbury Committee</em></div>

<p>Shortly afterward the Postmaster General, the Duke of Norfolk, and
the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hanbury, constituted
themselves a Committee to investigate the grievances that the
Tweedmouth Committee had left unredressed. All Members of the House
of Commons were invited to attend the meetings of the Norfolk-Hanbury
Committee, and to take part in examining the witnesses. Sir Albert
Rollit presented the case of the Post Office employees. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Norfolk-Hanbury Committee recommended further concessions involving an
additional outlay of $400,000 a year; and the Treasury accepted the
recommendations.</p>

<p>The Report of the Postmaster General for the year 1897-98 stated
that the concessions granted would entail a total increase of
expenditure of $1,940,000 a year. The Duke of Norfolk concluded his
reference to the foregoing episodes with the words: &ldquo;Since
that time I have declined, and I shall continue to decline, to allow
decisions which have been considered by the Tweedmouth Committee, and
which have been revised by Mr. Hanbury and myself, to be reopened.
It is my belief that those decisions have been liberal, but whether
they are liberal or not, it is for the interest of all parties that it
should be understood that they are final.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In April, 1900, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, stated the concessions granted by the Tweedmouth and
Norfolk-Hanbury Committees were costing $2,200,000 a year. In April,
1901, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said
they were costing $2,500,000 a year; and in April, 1903, he stated
that they were costing $3,000,000 a year.<a href="#Footnote_180_187"
id="FNanchor_180_187" class="fnanchor">180</a> Those figures related
to the combined postal and telegraph service. So far as the latter
service alone is concerned, the average expenses on account of wages
and salaries rose steadily from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
11.54 cents per telegram in 1895-96, to 13.02 cents in 1902-03, under
an increase in the number of messages from 79,423,000 in 1895-96, to
92,471,000 in 1902-03. In 1905-06, the average in question rose to
14.29 cents, partly in consequence of the increases in wages made in
response to the demands of the Civil Servants, partly in consequence of
the drop in the number of telegrams to 89,478,000&mdash;as a result of
the growing competition from the telephone.</p>

<p>In 1895-96 the receipts of the Telegraph Department proper
exceeded the operating expenses by $646,000; in 1900-01, the
operating expenses exceeded the receipts by $34,000; in 1903-04
the deficit rose to $1,505,000, and in 1904-05 it was $917,000.
In 1905-06, the gross revenue exceeded the operating expenses
by $63,500.<a href="#Footnote_181_188" id="FNanchor_181_188"

Minister, but that the franchise had been restored to them in
1868. That in that year both Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone had
approved the policy of enfranchising the employees of the Revenue
Departments, subject to the limitation that the ministerial heads
of the Departments were to have the power to determine the limits
within which the employees were to take an active part in politics.
That an attempt had been made in 1874 to remove that limitation, but
that the House had supported the Government of the day in resisting
the attempt.<a href="#Footnote_184_191" id="FNanchor_184_191"

   <em>House of Commons is Civil Servants&rsquo; Court of Appeal</em>
</div>

<p>Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and
representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General, the
Duke of Norfolk, said, in the course of his reply to Mr. Woods: &ldquo;We
must recognize the fact that in this House of Commons, public servants
have a Court of Appeal such as exists with regard to no private
employee whatever. It is a Court of Appeal which not only exists with
regard to the grievances of classes, and even of individuals, but it
is a Court of Appeal which applies even to the wages and duties of
classes and individuals,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and its functions in that respect are only limited by the common sense
of Members, who should exercise caution in bringing forward cases of
individuals, because, if political influence is brought to bear in
favor of one individual, the chances are that injury is done to some
other individual&hellip;. I think it is only reasonable to expect that,
as both [political] parties in the State have dropped party politics
with regard to their employees, the employees should in turn recognize
that fact, and drop party politics with regard to their employers.&rdquo; Mr.
Hanbury enforced this point by stating that, upon the request of the
Civil Servants themselves, Lord Rockingham, Prime Minister, in 1782
had disfranchised the Civil Servants in the Revenue Departments. At
that time the party in power, through the Public Service, controlled 70
seats in Parliament. Lord North, who had been in power twelve years,
had sent out notices to certain constituencies where the Civil Servants
were able to turn the scale, saying, that unless the Civil Servants
supported the Government, it would go hard with them. Thereupon the
Opposition had sent out counter notices, and thus had put the Civil
Service in an awkward position. The result had been that the Civil
Servants themselves had requested Lord Rockingham to disfranchise
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanbury continued with the statement that, in 1892, Sir James
Fergusson had dismissed Mr. Clery for ignoring his order forbidding
Civil Servants to &ldquo;circularize&rdquo; parliamentary candidates. Thereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Mr. Clery, at Newcastle-on-Tyne, had said to a political meeting
of postmen: &ldquo;They must approach the House of Commons on its weak
side; they must influence Members through their susceptibilities as
opportunity presents itself when candidates appeal to their respective
constituencies. A man is never more amenable to reason than when making
a request.&rdquo; Mr. Hanbury continued: &ldquo;What private employee is able to
say: &lsquo;I am the permanent servant of my employer; I have a share in
declaring who that employer shall be; I will attack him on his weak
side when he comes up for re-election, and then I will use my power? I
will bring organized pressure to bear throughout the constituencies,
and I will make this bargain: that if he will not vote for an increase
in my pay, or diminish my duties, then I will not give him my vote.&rsquo;
We have done away with personal and individual bribery, but there is
still a worse form of bribery, and that is when a man asks a candidate
to buy his vote out of the public purse. There are three great things
which distinguish our permanent public service. There is, in the first
place, the remarkable loyalty with which they serve both parties in
the State. Then there is the permanency of their employment. Again,
a great feature of that service is that no longer is it a question
of favoritism, but promotion by merit is the rule. Those three
great features have been slowly built upon this foundation&mdash;the
elimination altogether of the element of political partisanship from
the service. I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
nothing will be done to break down those foundations, on which alone
the public service can rest&mdash;a service which, for its efficiency,
its loyalty, and its high sense of public duty, I do not think is
surpassed. I doubt whether it is equalled or even approached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, replied that

to light since the Tweedmouth Committee and the Norfolk-Hanbury
Committee had made concessions entailing an annual expenditure of
$1,900,000 a year. The Post Office servants were demanding &ldquo;a
new judgment on the old facts.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;I confess,
I am not quite sure that we did not go too far [in 1897], because by
increasing these salaries we are bringing into this service an entirely
new social class; you are bringing in men who perhaps are socially
a little above their work, and these men naturally have a standard
of living and requirements which are not essential to men doing this
kind of work. If we are going to raise the salaries more and more, you
will get a higher social class into the service, and there will be
no limit to the demands made upon us.&rdquo; Mr. Hanbury continued:
&ldquo;You have got to trust the heads of the Departments, or get new
heads; it is quite impossible for the House of Commons to go into all
these technicalities, and I know no Department where the work is more
technical and more complicated than the Post Office. The Treasury work
is supposed to be hard to learn [by the Members of the House of Commons
working for promotion to the Ministry], but the technicalities of the
Post Office is about the most difficult job I ever had, and I do not
think a Select Committee would be really able to get to the bottom of
this matter. But, after all, we must recollect another fact, and it
is this: that the Civil Service is a great deal too much inclined to
attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to put pressure upon Members of Parliament. That is a very bad system,
upon which we ought to put our foot. It is bad enough when it is
brought to bear upon the House as a whole, but what would happen
with a Select Committee of this House? You would have the resentment
of the Civil Service focussed and concentrated upon the unfortunate
Members of the Committee, and I do not think it would act more
independently or more impartially than those two bodies which have sat
already.&rdquo;</p>

   <em>Civil Servants have &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; in the Commons</em>
</div>

<p>On June 1, 1899, Mr. Steadman moved the reduction of the
Postmaster General&rsquo;s salary by $500, by way of asking the House of
Commons to instruct the Government to appoint a Select Committee
of the House of Commons to investigate the grievances of the Post
Office employees.<a href="#Footnote_189_196" id="FNanchor_189_196" class="fnanchor">189</a> He said: &ldquo;It stands to reason that a
Departmental Committee [Tweedmouth Committee] composed of officials,
which contained only one impartial member&mdash;a Member of the House
of Lords&mdash;could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
not be satisfactory to the 160,000 male and female employees in the
Post Office service&hellip;. Every department of the Post Office
service now has its organization. All these organizations right through
the departments have their coaches and organizers; true, they are not
yet directly represented here in this House, but they have friends here
who are prepared to take up their quarrels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Norton<a href="#Footnote_190_197" id="FNanchor_190_197" class="fnanchor">190</a> seconded the Motion. He spoke of the fact that
any telegraphist could obtain $30 a year extra pay by making himself
competent to discharge the duties of a letter sorter, and another $30
by passing an examination on the technical questions of telegraphy. He
asserted that it was a grievance that the men had to acquire, in their
leisure hours, the additional proficiency in question; and that only
46 per cent. of the men were able to pass the examinations on the
technical questions involved in telegraphy.</p>

<p>Mr. Maddison<a href="#Footnote_191_198" id="FNanchor_191_198" class="fnanchor">191</a> supported Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s Motion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with the words: &ldquo;For my part, I have always had some hesitation in
taking up the cases of men employed by the State, because undoubtedly
there is a sort of notion that, because they are employed by the State,
they can make such demands as they like, because they are paid out
of a very full Treasury. I know that every half penny of that money
comes out of the general taxation of the country, and I agree that we
are here as the guardians of the public purse. The Right Honorable
Gentleman has never denied that we are here as the guardians of these
men&rsquo;s interest, and it has not been shown that the public interest is
of greater importance than the interest of these men, who do so much
for the prosperity of the Country&hellip;. In this case we want a
non-official committee, although I confess that I do not think such an
inquiry will put an end to disputes in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said that if the
Government yielded to the demand for a House of Commons Committee
in this case, there would be a House of Commons Committee sitting
practically every session of Parliament. The points now under
discussion had been under agitation for four, five, or six years.
Before the Tweedmouth Committee entered upon its duties, and before the
Norfolk-Hanbury Conference with Members of the House of Commons, the
Government had a distinct understanding with Members of the House that
the decisions come to should be accepted. Mr. Hanbury continued: &ldquo;It is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
somewhat difficult, no doubt, to draw a comparison between what the
Post Office pays and what is paid by private firms. But I will give
one comparison, at any rate, and I think it is the only one possible.
A few years ago we took over from the National Telephone Company the
employees, principally women, who were engaged on the [long-distance]
trunk wires, and I venture to say that, counting in the pensions we
pay, these people are receiving from 30 per cent. to 40 per cent.
larger salaries than when they were in the employment of the company.
Honorable Members who draw comparisons between servants of the State
and others, are too apt to forget the great facilities Post Office
servants get, such as constant employment, large pensions, good
holidays, for which they are paid, and large sick-pay and sick-leave.
If these are added together, it will be found that the Post Office is
paying wages considerably above the level of those paid by outside
employers. I should like to say one further word with regard to this
application for a Committee of this House. Why should we have it at
all? Let me speak with perfect frankness about this thing. We have
already had two Committees; we have also had a great deal of pressure
brought to bear upon Members; that pressure is becoming almost
intolerable. The honorable Member for Newington posed as the just
judge and said: &lsquo;I am weary of all this agitation; let us try to put
an end to it.&rsquo; Well I am not weary of the agitation; so long as I am
satisfied, as I am now, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
everything has been done that ought to be done for the men, I will
not yield to agitation. I say at once that I do myself believe that,
considering everything, and that full inquiry has already been held,
the only advantage these men could derive from a House of Commons
Committee would be that the agitation and pressure, now distributed
over the whole House, would be focussed and concentrated upon the
Select Committee. I, for one, am not prepared to grant a Committee of
that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s third demand for a Select Committee</em></div>

<p>On April 27, 1900, Mr. Steadman moved the reduction of the
Postmaster General&rsquo;s salary by $2,500.<a href="#Footnote_193_200" id="FNanchor_193_200" class="fnanchor">193</a> He said: &ldquo;I rise for
the purpose of advocating the claims of the 160,000 persons employed
in the Post Office for a fair and impartial Committee of Inquiry to be
elected by this House to look into their grievances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contention that there were grievances, Mr. Steadman supported
with the following
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
arguments. From 1881 to 1891, the Civil Service Commissioners, in
issuing notices that they would hold competitive examinations for
intending entrants into the telegraph service, had stated that in
London telegraphists had &ldquo;a prospect of obtaining [ultimately] $950 a
year.&rdquo; That, argued Mr. Steadman, was a contract between the Government
and the telegraphists who entered the London service between 1881 and
1891, that every such telegraphist should rise to $950. The Government
therefore had committed a breach of contract when, in 1892, it had
announced that good character and good skill as an operator would not
secure a telegraphist promotion to the senior class, in which the
salary rose from $800 a year to $950. To be eligible for promotion to
the senior class, a man must be not only an excellent telegraphist,
but must, in addition, possess such executive ability as would
enable him to act as an overseer, or as assistant to the Assistant
Superintendent.</p>

<p>Mr. Steadman continued: &ldquo;Now I come to the question of the postmen.
Goodness knows where all that $1,950,000 a year has gone to. You cannot
get away from the fact that the postman to-day in London commences
[at the age of 16 years to 18 years] with a minimum wage of $4.50 a
week&hellip;. Fancy that, Mr. Chairman, a man commencing on $4.50 a
week, and employed by the State in a Department that has a clean
profit of between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000.&rdquo; Mr. Steadman next
contended that a good conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
stripe&mdash;worth $13 a year&mdash;should be given every three years;
that the present period of five years was too long. Moreover, the
Department was altogether too rigorous in withholding good conduct
stripes for breaches of discipline. Mr. Steadman cited the following
instances to prove the necessity of an inquiry by Members of the House
of Commons into the discipline enforced by the Department. A man who
had served nine years as an auxiliary postman had been arrested on the
charge of stealing a postal money order. Though found not guilty by the
Court, he had been dismissed, without a certificate of good character.
Postman Taylor, of Stirling, after suffering an accident, was unable
to cover his route in the time fixed by the Post Office. Thereupon the
local postmaster had asked Taylor to retire on a pension. &ldquo;The latest
information that I have in regard to that case is that the man who is
now doing Taylor&rsquo;s duties, in order to get through his round in the
time allotted, has his son to help him.&rdquo; Again, the annual increment
had been withheld from one Lacon, a telegraphist at Birmingham, and
the local Secretary of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association. The
Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hanbury, had told Mr. Steadman that the
Superintendent at Birmingham reported that Lacon&rsquo;s increment had been
withheld because Lacon had been insubordinate while on duty. Lacon
had told Mr. Steadman that he had been disciplined because of his
connection with the union. Mr. Steadman added: &ldquo;I will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
not for one moment attempt to stand up in the House and attack
permanent officials who are not able to defend themselves; it would
be unmanly for me to do so. But I do say that I have as much right
to believe the statement of Lacon, as the Right Honorable Gentleman
[the Secretary to the Treasury] has to believe the statement of the
Birmingham Superintendent. There is only one way of proving these
cases, and that is for a Committee of impartial Members of this House
to be appointed before which the permanent official can state his case
and the men theirs. If that is done, the Members, if their minds are
<del>unbiassed</del><ins>unbiased</ins>, will very soon be able to
judge as to who is telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Commons reminded of Civil Servants&rsquo; votes</em></div>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit seconded Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s Motion, saying: &ldquo;and we
ought not to overlook the fact, that, rightly or wrongly, these men now
have votes, and if they cannot obtain redress for their grievances here
in the House of Commons, they will try to obtain it from our masters,
the electorate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and
representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General,
the Duke of Norfolk, &ldquo;on principle&rdquo; opposed the request for a Select
Committee. &ldquo;Well, I say that the House of Commons is the last body
which ought to interfere in these questions of the payment of our
public servants. It is the last body which ought to be appealed to as
regularly as it is by civil servants to raise their salaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
because that, after all, is the real object of this proposed committee.
Already I think the pressure brought to bear on individual Members,
and especially on Members who have a large number of civil servants
in their constituencies, has become perfectly intolerable, and civil
servants may depend upon it that it is the general opinion in this
House, although they may have their cause advocated by Members upon
whom they may be able to bring particular pressure, because large
numbers of them happen to live in the constituencies of those Members;
I repeat that they may depend upon it that in the opinion of the great
body of the Members of this House they are taking a highly irregular
course, and are in no way making their position more favorable in
the minds of the great majority of Members. Nothing will induce me
personally to agree to any committee such as has been suggested. And
while I object on principle, I object also because absolutely no
necessity has been shown for the committee&hellip;. The Duke of Norfolk
and I, because we were so desirous that no case of the slightest
grievance should be left untouched, inquired into every grievance
which was said to have been left unredressed by the Tweedmouth
Committee&hellip;. Every Member of the House had a right to attend
our [Norfolk-Hanbury Committee] meetings, and to cross-examine the
witnesses&hellip;. It is the intention of the Post Office and of the
Treasury to carry out the recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee
to the very fullest extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and if the honorable Member [Mr. Steadman] is able to show me any
case whatever in which that has not been done, even in the case of
an individual postman, or sorter, or telegraphist, I will go into it
myself, and I will do more: I will promise that the grievance shall be
redressed.&rdquo;</p>

courage by throwing the responsibility for redressing the grievance of
the Post Office servants on the other House [Lord Tweedmouth] or the
permanent officials of any Department whatsoever.&rdquo; Mr. Bayley had begun
his

political career as a Town Councillor in Nottingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Anxiety</em></div>

<p>After many Members had supported the request for a Select
Committee, the Prime Minister, Mr. A. J. Balfour, said: &ldquo;I have
listened with great interest to this debate, and, I confess frankly,
with considerable anxiety as to the future of the public service if
pressure of the kind which has been put upon the Government to-night
is persisted in by this House. This House is omnipotent. It can make
and unmake Governments. It can decide what, when, and how public money
is to be spent. But with that omnipotence I would venture to urge upon
Members their great responsibility with a subject like this. Everyone
knows that a great organized body like the Post Office Service has in
its power to put great pressure upon Members, but I earnestly urge upon
honorable Gentlemen that unless we take our courage in both hands, and
say that, although most desirous that all legitimate grievances shall
be dealt with, we cannot permit the Government as a great employer of
labor to have this kind of pressure put upon it, I think the future of
the public service is in peril. I assure the committee that I speak
with a great sense of responsibility. In this very case the Post Office
employees have brought forward their grievances year after year. Two
Commissions have been appointed, and no one ever ventured to impugn
the ability or impartiality of the members of those Commissions. These
Commissions made the fullest examination into the case put
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
before them, and reported at length, and as a consequence of that
report the British taxpayers are now paying $2,500,000 more of money
than they paid before&hellip;. In none of the speeches has any specific
complaint been brought forward, or any point urged which suggests the
necessity for further inquiry, but only the statement that there is
a feeling of uneasiness, and a desire for further examination, and
that when such a desire is expressed, the House should listen to it.
We cannot keep the Civil Service in a sound and healthy condition if
we are going to examine into it by a committee every five years. If
the House of Commons were to yield to the very natural temptation
of granting a committee such as had been asked for, though we might
escape an inconvenient division, we should be unworthy, in my opinion,
of bearing any longer the great responsibility of being the enormous
employer of labor that we are. We should not be carrying out our
duty to the public, and, worst of all, we should aim a blow at the
Civil Service, which is the boast of this country and the envy of the
civilized world, because we should become the parliamentary creatures
of every organized body of public servants who chose to use the great
power which the Constitution gives, for ends which I am sure they
believe to be right, but which this House could not yield to in the
manner now suggested without derogating from the high functions and
spirit of pure impartiality which the House must maintain if Members
are to do their duty by their constituents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On April 18, 1902, while the House of Commons was in Committee of

Salaries and Working Expenses of the Post Office Telegraph Service:
$12,056,250.<a href="#Footnote_199_206" id="FNanchor_199_206" class="fnanchor">199</a> He said: &ldquo;The case briefly was this, that the
Government had been guilty of a distinct breach of faith in connection
with a certain number of worthy Government officials. He knew that to
make this statement of breach of faith was what must be called a strong
order, but he was prepared to prove that he was not exaggerating in
the smallest degree.&rdquo; He went on to state that the telegraphists who
entered the service in London in 1881 to 1891, when the Civil Service
Commissioners had advertised that entrants had &ldquo;a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
prospect of obtaining $950,&rdquo; had a contract with the Government
that the possession of &ldquo;ordinary manipulative ability, with regular
attendance and good conduct&rdquo; would insure advancement to a position
paying $950. The Government had broken that contract by prescribing,
in 1892, that men &ldquo;must be equal to supervising duties&rdquo; in order to be
promoted to the positions carrying $950.</p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit<a href="#Footnote_200_207" id="FNanchor_200_207" class="fnanchor">200</a> supported Captain Norton with the words: &ldquo;For
a long time past there had been a very strong and general feeling in
the service that many of the men had been the victims of something
amounting almost to an imposition, however unintentional, on the part
of a public Department. Strong terms had been used in the course
of the debate, but he should endeavor to deal with the matter on
the basis of what he believed to have been a contract between those
employees and the Post Office. It was not difficult to show that that
implied&mdash;or, he might even say, express&mdash;contract had induced
many to enter the service, only to find that the contract was afterward
departed from by one of the contracting parties, the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Keir Hardie supported Captain Norton&rsquo;s Motion with the argument
that the concessions made by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Tweedmouth Committee had imposed no additional burdens upon the
taxpayers, for that committee merely had allocated a small portion of
the extra profit made by the Post Office to the Post Office servants
who made that profit. Mr. Keir Hardie at one time has held the office
of Chairman of the Independent Labor Party,<a href="#Footnote_201_208" id="FNanchor_201_208" class="fnanchor">201</a> an organization
that brings to bear upon the British municipal governments a pressure
similar to that here shown to be brought upon the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Members of Parliament coerced</em></div>

<p>Mr. Gibson Bowles said: &ldquo;He was aware that many honorable Members
who brought forward the position of servants of the State, did so
against their own desires, because of the almost irresistible pressure
placed upon them by the servants of the State, who were at the same
time electors&hellip;. He supported the Secretary to the Treasury in
resisting this particular amendment, because it was one of many which
tended to illustrate a form of tyranny that was becoming unbearable,
and which tended seriously to injure the character of this House as
making its Members the advocates of classes, sections, and little
communities, instead of being trustees not for them alone, but for the
whole community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and
representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General, the
Marquis of Londonderry, said he &ldquo;supposed it would not be unfair to say
that an officer joining the British Army had a prospect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of becoming a field marshal.&rdquo; As to the telegraphists, &ldquo;all that the
Government ever had held out to them was a prospect of a certain number
of them attaining something beyond the ordinary maximum&rdquo; of $800,
to which any man could rise by the display of ordinary manipulative
ability and the observance of good conduct. Under Mr. Fawcett, in 1881
to 1884, one telegraphist out of every 6.3 telegraphists had risen
beyond $800. In 1890 the proportion in question had been exactly the
same. In 1902, the proportion was one in six, or, &ldquo;practically the
same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain continued: &ldquo;When I consider the great
concessions that were made [by the Tweedmouth Committee], and the great
burden that was placed upon the taxpayers, the care that was given to
that inquiry, and the opportunity that was afforded to every one to
have their grievances heard, I cannot pretend to think that a case has
been made out for trying, not fresh matters, but for retrying the same
matters and changing the tribunal, merely because all its decisions
[<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, some of its decisions] were not agreeable to one of the
parties concerned. I hope the House will not do anything so fatal to
the efficiency and the organization of our Civil Service, as to allow
any large body of civil servants to think that they have only to be
importunate enough to secure in this House repeated inquiries into
their grievances, no matter what previous care has been given to their
consideration. I trust this House will have confidence in the desire of
the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Postmaster General to deal fairly with all his employees, and believe
me when I say that there is nothing easier for us to do than to give
way; and that it is only because we believe it to be our duty to the
taxpayers that we find it necessary to refuse these recurring and
increasing demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Norton&rsquo;s Motion was lost by a vote of 164 to 134.
It was supported by one hundred and twenty-three Opposition members,
and by seven Government supporters.<a href="#Footnote_202_209"
id="FNanchor_202_209" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>A few hours later, Mr. Thomas Bayley<a href="#Footnote_203_210"
id="FNanchor_203_210" class="fnanchor">203</a> moved a reduction
of $500 on the salary of the Postmaster General, in order to call
attention to the grievances of the officials of the Post Office.<a
href="#Footnote_204_211" id="FNanchor_204_211" class="fnanchor">204</a>
He said there should be a Court of Appeal for the civil servants, and
that Court should be the House of Commons alone; whenever a dispute
arose between the Government of the day and its servants, the House
should constitute itself the Court of Appeal. Mr. Bayley added:
&ldquo;It had been distinctly laid down that it was no part of the duty
of the Post Office to make a profit, but it should be worked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
for the future convenience of the public and not reduced to the level
of a mere profit making machine. It was this desire on the part of
the Post Office officials to make profit which lay at the root of all
the troubles which the House had been discussing in the debate that
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and
representative, in the House of Commons, of the Postmaster General,
replied: &ldquo;I refuse to resign one particle of my responsibility, or
to accept the suggestion that the Government should wash their hands
of their responsibility, and throw the subject, as an open question,
before the House of Commons, and ask a Committee of this House, without
aid or guidance from responsible Ministers, to judge upon the multitude
of conflicting interests and details incident to the administration of
so great a service as the Post Office. I, for one, will not be party
to putting off that responsibility on to the House of Commons&hellip;.
But we consider that it would be a grave dereliction of duty on our
part to throw this great service into the turmoil and confusion of
a Parliamentary inquiry, with the knowledge that such an inquiry
would not be final&mdash;honorable Gentlemen who have supported this
Amendment have declared that to talk about finality in this matter is
absurd&mdash;with the knowledge that what is done to-day for the Post
Office, must be done to-morrow for every other Department employing a
large number of Government servants, until elections
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to this House will depend more and more on the willingness of Members
to purchase the support of those who are in public employment by
promises of concessions at the public expense, instead of securing
their support, like that of other citizens, on public grounds and
national interests.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Government&rsquo;s Compromise</em></div>

<p>On April 30, 1903, while the House was in Committee of Supply,
Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Postmaster General, prefaced the discussion
by the Committee of the Post Office Vote, with the following
statement:<a href="#Footnote_205_212" id="FNanchor_205_212" class="fnanchor">205</a>&hellip;. &ldquo;The demand is that a Select
Committee of this House should be appointed to examine into the
grievances of the Post Office staff. I have made it my business since
I have been at the post office to see that every memorial from the
staff dealing with their grievances, addressed to me, should come
before me personally&hellip;. Even though I have felt that many of
the matters thus brought to my notice were very small details of
administration. I am determined that an official [employee] of the Post
Office, going to the head of his service, should receive as fair and
careful consideration of his appeal, if he applies to me direct, as
if he sought Parliamentary influence to urge his claim. And I venture
to think that nothing has occurred during the time that I have been
responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which can justify any servant of the Post Office in saying that he
is unable, except by Parliamentary influence, or by Parliamentary
exposure, to obtain the attention of the head of the Department. The
other day at the request of several Members on both sides of the House,
I met the Members themselves, and consented that if they wished, they
should be accompanied by members of the Post Office Staff, who should
make before them, and in my presence, a statement of the grounds on
which they asked for this inquiry by a Select Committee, in order that
then and there I might discuss it with my honorable friends. The Vote
comes on to-night, and I intend to take this opportunity of making
a few observations on the grounds for this Parliamentary inquiry as
put forth by the Staff. There are three main grounds alleged by the
spokesman for the staff for a Parliamentary inquiry&mdash;wages,
sanitation [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, the sanitary condition of certain offices], and
meal reliefs, or the time allowed out of working hours for taking
refreshment. If a person does eight hours&rsquo; continuous work he is
allowed half an hour out of that time for a meal, reducing his actual
working hours to seven and a half hours&hellip;. I only wish to draw
the attention of the committee to what was described to me as a typical
grievance by the spokesman of a deputation which waited on me shortly
before Christmas. Certain men are on duty from 10 a. m. to 2 p. m., and
from 4 p. m. to 8 p. m., and complain because they are not allowed 20
minutes for tea.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
In the judgment of any impartial person, was that a reasonable
grievance&hellip;? I myself have come to the conclusion, &hellip;
that while a great number of the complaints made have no foundation
in justice, and that a great number of the men who think themselves
aggrieved would find it difficult to get, elsewhere than in the public
service, such good employment as they have now, there are other cases
which are open to improvement and for which further inquiry is needed
to fix exactly what should be done. The Government is unalterably
opposed to a Select Committee of the House of Commons for the decision
of this question. Honorable Members know, and it is no use blinking it,
the kind of pressure which is brought to bear, or is attempted to be
brought to bear, upon Members in all parts of the House by the public
servants, servants of the Post Office, I am afraid, especially, though
not entirely [exclusively], at election times. I have had Members come
to me, not from one side of the House alone, to seek from me, in my
position as Postmaster General, protection for them in the discharge
of their public duties against the pressure sought to be put upon them
by the employees of the Post Office. Even if the machinery by which
our Select Committees are appointed were such as would enable us to
secure a Select Committee composed of thoroughly impartial men who had
committed themselves by no expression of opinion, I still think that it
would not be fair to pick out fifteen Members of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
House and make them marked men for the purposes of such pressure as
is now distributed more or less over the whole Assembly. But if I am
opposed to the appointment of a House of Commons Committee for fixing
wages in the Post Office, I am still more opposed to thrusting upon
it, or, indeed, on any Committee, the duty of regulating in all its
details the daily administration and work of the Post Office. The wages
paid are not in all respects satisfactory, some are too low, others
are too high. Advice from men of practical and business experience
would help me, the Minister in this matter. Therefore, I propose to
take such advice&mdash;of men as free from any kind of political and
electoral pressure, as they should be free from any departmental
influence. I should suggest a body of five to report for my advice and
information on the wages paid in the Post Office Department to the four
great classes of employees, the letter sorters and the telegraphists
in London, and the letter sorters and the telegraphists in the
provinces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After reiterating that he proposed to get the advice of business
men only on the question of the scale of wages paid in the Post
Office Department, and that he in no way proposed to surrender to any
Committee of any sort the general duties of the Postmaster General, Mr.
Austen Chamberlain closed with the words: &ldquo;I ask the Committee [of
Supply] to give me all the confidence it can, and when it is unable to
give me that confidence, I say that that is no reason for granting a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Select Committee to do my work, but only a reason for transferring the
office of Postmaster General to someone who is more competent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Bayley replied that &ldquo;he was not willing to give up
the rights and privileges of the House of Commons, whose duty it was
to remedy the grievances of the public service&hellip;. And although
he had been assured by those whom he represented [<span lang="la"
xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, post office servants] that the Post Office
officials would loyally abide by the decision of a Committee of the
House of Commons, the Right Honorable Gentleman [the Postmaster
General] could not expect the same loyalty with regard to the decision
of the Committee he proposed to appoint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit said: &ldquo;The Tweedmouth Committee was a one-sided
tribunal; the officials were represented on it, but the men not at
all&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Norton replied: &ldquo;The Right Honorable Gentleman had also
referred to the question of Members on both sides of the House coming
to him for protection. That was very startling, because the reason
they were there at all was that they might represent every section of
their constituents,<a href="#Footnote_206_213" id="FNanchor_206_213" class="fnanchor">206</a> &hellip; but presuming the Post Office
servants were organized, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
submitted they were within their rights to appeal to their
Members&hellip;. If the postal officials were such terrible tyrants
he hoped they would take note that they could never hope for fair
play from the present Government. The Right Honorable Gentleman had
appointed a packed jury of five individuals to deal with a fraction
of the question&hellip;. In other words, he was going to take shelter
behind this bogus committee&hellip;. He was going to appoint five
Members, possibly sweaters, to determine the rate of wages&hellip;. It
would be astounding if the postal officials accepted any such bogus
arbitration. If it was to be a Board of Arbitration, why should not
they have five postal servants added to the five employers of labor?&rdquo;
Captain Norton is a Junior Lord of the Treasury in the present Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman Ministry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On May 17, 1903, the National Joint Committee of the Postal
Association unanimously resolved: &ldquo;That this National Joint
Committee views with extreme dissatisfaction the appointment of a
Court of Inquiry which is not composed of members of Parliament,
but is an altogether irresponsible body, and protests against
the scope of the inquiry being limited to a single grievance and
to a minority of the Staff. It pledges itself to continue to use
every legitimate endeavor to obtain an impartial Parliamentary
Committee of Inquiry into the causes of discontent in the postal and
telegraph service.<a href="#Footnote_207_214" id="FNanchor_207_214" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>In August, 1903, the Postmaster General appointed a &ldquo;Committee to
inquire into the adequacy of the wages paid to certain classes of the
postal servants.&rdquo; The Committee consisted of: Sir Edward Bradford,
until lately Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police; Mr. Charles
Booth, a Liverpool Merchant, and the author of &ldquo;The Life and Labor of
the People in London;&rdquo; Mr. Samuel Fay, General Manager of the Great
Central Railway; Mr. Thomas Brodrick, Secretary of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society, Manchester; and Mr. R. Burbridge, Managing Director

     CHAPTER XII <br /><span class="smcap">The Bradford Committee
     Report</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The Bradford Committee ignores its reference. It recommends
   measures that would cost $6,500,000 a year, in the hope of
   satisfying the postal employees, who had asked for $12,500,000
   a year. Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, rejects the Bradford
   Committee&rsquo;s Report; but grants increases in wages and salaries
   aggregating $1,861,500 a year.</p>
</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter it was stated that the Government in
August, 1903, appointed Sir Edward Bradford, Mr. Charles Booth, Mr.
Thomas Brodrick, Mr. R. Burbidge, and Mr. Samuel Fay a Committee
&ldquo;to inquire into the scales of pay received by the undermentioned
classes of Established Post Office Servants, and to report whether,
having regard to the conditions of their employment and to the rates
current in other occupations, the remuneration of (a) Postmen, (b)
Sorters (London), (c) Telegraphists (London), (d) Sorting Clerks and
Telegraphists (Provincial) is adequate.&rdquo; No further question was
submitted to the Committee.</p>

<p>The Committee, in May, 1904, reported: &ldquo;We have not seen our way
to obtain any specific evidence as to the comparative rates of wages
current in other occupations.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
So far as regards this portion of the reference to us,<a href="#Footnote_209_216" id="FNanchor_209_216" class="fnanchor">209</a>
we came to the conclusion that no really useful purpose would be served
by asking employers of labor to furnish precise details of the wages
paid by them. Certain official information is already available, being
obtained and published from time to time by the Board of Trade. This
information, supplemented by our own experience, affords more reliable
data than any particulars we could hope to obtain in the way of
evidence within the limits of an inquiry of reasonable duration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Business Methods not applicable in State Service</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover, it is difficult to make any valid comparison between
a National Postal Service and any form of private industrial
employment, the entire conditions being necessarily so different;
payment by results and promotion or dismissal according to the
will of the employer being inapplicable if not impossible under
the State.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_210_217" id="FNanchor_210_217" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>The Committee&rsquo;s report covers nineteen pages, but only these two
paragraphs are in answer to the reference given to the Committee. In
them the Committee reports its failure; and with that report of failure
the Committee should have contented itself, under all of the rules of
procedure governing Committees and Commissions appointed by the British
Government. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Committee ignored the established rules of procedure, roamed about
at will, and reopened many of the questions settled by the Tweedmouth
Committee, which had sat two years, and had taken upward of a thousand
closely printed folio pages of evidence. The Bradford Committee did
this in violation of the established usage of the country, as well
as in spite of the fact that Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Postmaster
General, had closed the speech in which he announced his resolve to
appoint the Committee, with the words that he wanted advice on the
question of comparative wages only and that he refused to transfer to
&ldquo;any Committee the duty of regulating in all its details the daily
administration and work of the Post Office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon the Report of the Committee, <cite>The Economist</cite><a href="#Footnote_211_218" id="FNanchor_211_218" class="fnanchor">211</a>
(London) commented as follows: &ldquo;This Committee was asked to compare
the wages of Post Office servants with those paid for corresponding
work outside. Their answer was, in effect, that no such comparison
could be instituted. Why, when postal servants are taken from various
ascertained classes [of society], it should be impossible to compare
their pay with that ordinarily received by the same classes in other
employments is not obvious. What is obvious is that the Committee
either mistook the inquiry entrusted to them, or did not choose to
enter upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>The Times</cite><a href="#Footnote_212_219" id="FNanchor_212_219" class="fnanchor">212</a> said: &ldquo;The reference here is explicit, &hellip;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
The specific question they were asked was the question to which, as our
Correspondent says, the taxpayer really wants an answer&mdash;namely,
are postal servants fairly paid&hellip;? This question the Committee
has neither answered nor attempted to answer. Passing by the
terms of reference altogether, the Report declares that &lsquo;it is
difficult&rsquo;&hellip;. But, as an answer to the specific question
addressed to the Committee; it is, in our judgment, in the literal
sense of the word, impertinent. However, having rejected the criterion
propounded to them by the Postmaster General, the Committee proposed
to apply a criterion of their own&hellip;.&rdquo; The Committee made some
general statements as to the rates of wages that should prevail in
the public service. They were: &ldquo;We think that Postal employees are
justified in resting their claims to remuneration on the responsible
and exacting<a href="#Footnote_213_220" id="FNanchor_213_220" class="fnanchor">213</a> character of the duties performed and on the
social position they fill as servants of the State. The State, for its
part, does right in taking an independent course guided by principles
of its own, irrespective of what others may do; neither following an
example nor pretending to set one. It must always be remembered that in
the working of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
monopoly by the State, the interest of the public as a whole is the
paramount consideration, and every economy consistent with efficiency
must be adopted. The terms offered by the State should, however, be
such as to secure men and women of the requisite character and capacity
and ought to be such as will insure the response of hearty service.&rdquo;
If one seeks to find in the foregoing statements an answer to the very
matter-of-fact question whether the postal servants&rsquo; wages are too high
or too low, compared with wages in outside employment, he will have to
conclude, with <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, that &ldquo;it seems very pretty, but
it&rsquo;s rather hard to understand; somehow it seems to fill my head with
ideas, only I don&rsquo;t know exactly what they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Committee concluded with the statement that the adequacy of
the wages obtaining among the postal employees could be tested by the
numbers and character of those who offered themselves; by the capacity
they showed on trial; and finally, by their contentment. It found that
there was no lack of suitable candidates; that there was no complaint
as to their capacity; but that there was widespread discontent. It
added that the Tweedmouth and Norfolk-Hanbury settlements did not
give satisfaction at the time; and that that dissatisfaction had been
&ldquo;aggravated by the general rise in wages and prices and in the standard
of life which took place to some extent even during the two years
occupied by the Tweedmouth inquiry (1895 and 1896) and had continued
since, culminating, however, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
1900, since when there has been some slight reaction. The same period
has seen a great development of Postal and Telegraph business, causing
greater pressure of work. This has been combined with lower charges to
the public and a considerable increase in Postal Revenue. We therefore
consider there is a just claim for revision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking these statements in their order, one finds, first of all,
that the Committee took no evidence on the question how Post Office
wages had compared with wages in outside employment previous to the
rise in wages and prices in the period from 1895 to 1900, nor on the
question of the rise in wages in the Post Office Service in 1896
to 1900, compared with the rise in wages in outside employment and
in prices in 1895 to 1900. The first statement of the Committee,
therefore, was supported by no evidence, it was a mere assertion. The
second statement, namely, that the growth of the Postal and Telegraph
business had caused greater pressure of work, also was not supported
by evidence. On the other hand, it was absolutely essential that such
a statement should be supported by evidence, because it is a fact that
in both branches of the Postal Service the policy obtains of having
so large a body of employees &ldquo;that the maximum of work, as a rule,
can be dealt with without undue pressure.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_214_221" id="FNanchor_214_221" class="fnanchor">214</a> As to the Post Office
having lowered its charges to the public in the period from 1895 to
1900, it is to be said, first,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
that it does not follow therefrom that wages should be raised; and
second, that the penny rate on domestic letters was not lowered, and
that the carriage of penny letters is the only work upon which the Post
Office makes a profit.<a href="#Footnote_215_222" id="FNanchor_215_222" class="fnanchor">215</a> Finally, as to the statement that there had
been, in 1895 to 1904, &ldquo;a considerable increase in Postal Revenue,&rdquo;
the facts are, first, that the net revenue of the Post Office as a
whole increased from $14,640,000 in 1895, to $18,166,000 in 1896,
and to $18,781,000 in 1897; but that in the subsequent years, 1898
to 1904, it did not again reach the high-water mark of 1897, and
averaged $17,642,000. Second, that in the period, from 1895 to 1904,
the Telegraph Branch did not earn operating expenses, the expenses on
account of wages and salaries having risen from 11.9 cents per telegram
in 1897, to 13.7 cents in 1904. That is a matter of importance, for
the recommendations of the Committee extended to the Telegraph Branch
as well as to the Postal Branch proper. Again, the Committee had
stated that &ldquo;in the working of a monopoly by the State, the interest
of the public as a whole is the paramount consideration, and every
economy consistent with efficiency must be adopted.&rdquo; In the 20 years
ending with 1903, the proportion of the Post Office&rsquo;s gross revenue
available for defraying the general expenses of the State had declined
steadily from 33 per cent. to 20 per cent.<a href="#Footnote_216_223" id="FNanchor_216_223" class="fnanchor">216</a> Still, again, in the
year 1903,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the expenses of the Post Office had been increased by $3,000,000
through the Tweedmouth and Norfolk-Hanbury settlements.<a href="#Footnote_217_224" id="FNanchor_217_224" class="fnanchor">217</a>
In the face of those facts, the Bradford Committee made recommendations
that Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, said would cost $6,500,000
a year.<a href="#Footnote_218_225" id="FNanchor_218_225" class="fnanchor">218</a> The Bradford Committee sought to justify its
recommendations with the simple statement that there was &ldquo;widespread
discontent&rdquo; among the Postal employees. The Postal employees themselves
had made demands before the Committee that would have called for the
expenditure of an additional $12,500,000 a year. Their attitude to
the Committee&rsquo;s amiable proposal to conciliate them by giving them
$6,500,000 a year, is shown in the subjoined extract from the official
organ of the telegraph staff. &ldquo;It is perfectly plain, &hellip; that the
recommendations of the Committee, well-meaning as we frankly admit them
to be, cannot be accepted as a full settlement of the case of the Post
Office workers, or as one carrying with it the character of finality.
They can only be accepted as an instalment of a long overdue account;
and Postal Telegraphists, even if they have to fight alone for their
own hand in the future as they did for many long years in the past,
will combine for the payment of the balance.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_219_226" id="FNanchor_219_226" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>That a body of five men, of whom four were respectively a Liverpool
merchant and ship owner, a general manager of a railway, a manager of
a large wholesale co&ouml;perative society, and a manager of a large
department store, could make a Report such as the foregoing one,
affords a melancholy illustration of the fact that no matter how far
popular governments may go in assuming the conduct of great business
enterprises, they never will succeed in creating a public opinion that
will sustain them in their efforts to conduct their business ventures
on the commonly accepted principles of the business world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the House of Commons, Lord Stanley, the Postmaster General,
said: &ldquo;As to the Committee&rsquo;s Report, it did not comply with the
reference, because no comparison was made with the rates of pay
in other occupations &hellip; but they conclude that as there was
discontent there ought to be an increase of wages. That was a direct
premium on discontent, a direct encouragement to the employees to
say among themselves that if they were to be discontented and to
agitate, they would get more in the future. The Committee, on the other
hand, went outside the reference, because they proposed a complete
reorganization of the Post Office, including overseers, who were not
referred to in the reference. On this particular subject they took no
evidence&hellip;. Since the employees of the Post Office had said in a
circular: &lsquo;We wish to make it perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
clear that we do not regard the Committee as in any sense an
arbitration board,&rsquo; that was rather against the argument that the
Report ought to be accepted as an arbitration award. He did not
complain of the ordinary circulars of the employees [sent to Members of
Parliament], but he did object to one circular [sent to every Member of
the House of Commons], at the bottom of which was a paragraph, which
could be torn off, for Members to sign [and mail to the Postmaster
General], informing him [the Postmaster General] that he ought to
do this or that.<a href="#Footnote_220_227" id="FNanchor_220_227" class="fnanchor">220</a> That [circular] he [Lord Stanley] would
not receive&hellip;. Coming to the main question, he thought it was
obvious that it was impossible for either side when in power to go on
for long being swayed in all these questions of increases of wages by
any pressure, political or otherwise, that might be put upon them.
[Cheers.] The Post Office was not the only party concerned. There was
not a class employed by the Government, who, if it saw another class
getting an increase of wages by agitation, would not try the same
method. He supported cordially the suggestion which had been made in
the debate that all questions of pay of employees of the Government
should not be referred to the House, but referred to some judicial body
on whom no outside influence could be brought to bear, who would look at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the matter in dispute as between employer and employee with the
object of giving to the employee the wages which in the open market
a good employer would give, while at the same time protecting
the master&mdash;in this case the State&mdash;from any outside
influence.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_221_228" id="FNanchor_221_228" class="fnanchor">221</a> In conclusion, Lord Stanley made the statement
that the adoption of the Committee&rsquo;s Report would cost &ldquo;well over
$5,000,000 a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Albert Rollit acted as the spokesman of the Postal employees. He
is a Solicitor in Mincing Lane and at Hull; a steamship owner at Hull,
Newcastle and London; and a Director in the National Telephone Company,
which pays its employees materially less than the Post Office pays the
employees of the Post Office Telephone system.<a href="#Footnote_222_229" id="FNanchor_222_229" class="fnanchor">222</a> He has been President
of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom, as well
as of the London and Hull Chambers of Commerce. He was Mayor of Hull
from 1883 to 1885; and for several years past he has been the President
of the Association of Municipal Corporations. Sir Albert K. Rollit was
not re-elected to Parliament in the General Election of January, 1906;
and in the following March, the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association
passed a resolution &ldquo;expressing appreciation of the services rendered
to the Postal movement in and out of Parliament by Sir Albert K.
Rollit, and regret
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
that they were no longer able to command his championship in the
House of Commons.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_223_230" id="FNanchor_223_230" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>After the Balfour Government had rejected the Report of the
Bradford Committee, in the interest of the taxpayers, Lord Stanley,
Postmaster General, instituted &ldquo;a careful comparison between Post
Office wages and those current in other employments; and, as the
result of the comparison, he felt justified in recommending to the
Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury certain improvements
of pay&rdquo; aggregating $1,861,500 a year.<a href="#Footnote_224_231" id="FNanchor_224_231" class="fnanchor">224</a> The improvements
of pay were granted to sorters, telegraphists, sorting clerks and
telegraphists, postmen, assistant and auxiliary postmen, and various
smaller classes throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

   CHAPTER XIII <br /><span class="smcap">The House of Commons
   Select Committee on Post Office Servants</span>, 1906
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The Post Office Civil Servants&rsquo; Unions demand the adoption
   of the Bradford Committee Report. Lord Stanley, Postmaster
   General, applies the words &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; and &ldquo;blood-sucking&rdquo;
   to the postal employees&rsquo; methods. Captain Norton moves for a
   House of Commons Select Committee. Mr. Austen Chamberlain,
   Chancellor of the Exchequer, in vain asks the Opposition
   Party&rsquo;s support for a Select Committee to which shall be
   referred the question of the feasibility of establishing a
   permanent, non-political Commission which shall establish
   general principles for settling disputes between the Civil
   Servants and the Government of the day. Captain Norton&rsquo;s
   Motion is lost, nine Ministerial supporters voting for it, and
   only two Opposition members voting against it. Mr. J. Henniker
   Heaton&rsquo;s appeal to the British public for &ldquo;An End to Political
   Patronage.&rdquo; The Post Office employees, in the campaign
   preceding the General Election of January, 1906, induce nearly
   450 of the 670 parliamentary candidates who succeeded in being
   elected, to pledge themselves to vote for a House of Commons
   Select Committee on Post Office Wages. Immediately upon the
   opening of Parliament, the Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman Liberal
   Ministry gives the Post Office employees a House of Commons
   Select Committee.</p>
</div>

<p>On September 17, 1904, the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association
unanimously resolved: &ldquo;That this Conference expresses its indignation
that the Postmaster General, having appointed a Committee of his own
choosing to inquire into the Post Office wages &hellip; now, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
no good reason, has rejected the Report. This Conference, therefore,
calls upon the Postmaster General to adopt immediately, as dated
from May 9, 1904, the whole of the ameliorative recommendations
contained in the Bradford Committee&rsquo;s Report; but the Postal
Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association reserves to itself the right to
object to, and protest against, any recommendations which may be
considered by this Association to be of a restrictive and retrograde
character.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_225_232" id="FNanchor_225_232" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A Merchant in Politics</em></div>

<p>In the evening of the same day a mass meeting was addressed by
Mr. W. W. Rutherford, M. P., the head of the firm of Miller, Peel,
Hughes and Rutherford, Liverpool. Mr. Rutherford had been Lord Mayor
of Liverpool in 1902. He said: &ldquo;He ventured to think that the great
Postal and Telegraph Service was suffering because its position and
its grievances had not been made thoroughly intelligible to the
general public&hellip;. That was not a matter touching a few hundreds
of people in a hole and corner of the country, but was one of extreme
importance affecting no less than 185,000 people&hellip;. The real foes
of the employees were the highly paid officials at the head of the
Department, who were quite content to draw their salaries and show
that the Government was making four or five million pounds sterling<a href="#Footnote_226_233" id="FNanchor_226_233" class="fnanchor">226</a>
out of the public and the Postal Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Rutherford&rsquo;s speech recalls to mind the fact that the Australian
cousins of the British civil servants have learned to deal with their
&ldquo;foes&rdquo; by compelling the popular branches of the Australian Parliaments
to reduce the salaries of offensive officials, or to drive them out of
the Service by means of &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; Parliamentary Committees, appointed
to report on&mdash;and to condemn&mdash;the offending officials.</p>

<p>On August 14, 1904, the London Branch of the Postal Telegraph
Clerks&rsquo; Association held a meeting, at which Mr. C. H. Garland,<a href="#Footnote_227_234" id="FNanchor_227_234" class="fnanchor">227</a>
the Secretary, spoke of Mr. Thomas Bayley, M. P., as one who &ldquo;had
rendered valuable service to their cause in the House of Commons.&rdquo;
The presiding officer, Mr. R. H. Davis, said: &ldquo;In burking the
recommendations of the Committee they could not help feeling that the
Post Office authorities had been guilty of a breach of faith. Were
they going to take the rebuff lying down? The London Committee were
determined to fight the matter harder than ever. By the time Parliament
assembled next year, they would have an effective organization
at their disposal, and the enemy would feel their pressure very
considerably.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_228_235" id="FNanchor_228_235" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>The Special Conference of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association
held on September 17, 1904, resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to hold mass meetings in all the district centres between then
and next February [opening of Parliament] to protest against the
action of the Postmaster General. The series to conclude with a
&ldquo;monster&rdquo; demonstration in London immediately before the opening
of Parliament.<a href="#Footnote_229_236" id="FNanchor_229_236" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On July 6, 1905, while the House of Commons was in Committee of
Supply, and was considering the vote upon the Post Office, there
was a long and instructive debate upon the Report of the Bradford
Committee.<a href="#Footnote_230_237" id="FNanchor_230_237" class="fnanchor">230</a> Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, opened
the debate with a quotation from <cite>The Post</cite>,<a href="#Footnote_231_238" id="FNanchor_231_238" class="fnanchor">231</a> the Post Office
employees&rsquo; organ. The statement quoted read: &ldquo;Not only do we object to
the composition of the [Bradford] Committee, but we take the strongest
exception to its terms of reference. The inquiry as to whether our
wages are adequate or otherwise becomes a farce if their adequacy is to
be judged by the standard of wages of the open labor market. No such
comparison would be reasonable or fair. There is no other employer who
fixes his own prices or makes an annual profit of $20,000,000. There is
no other class of work which can be compared to the Post Office work,
neither any other employee who can be compared with the Post Office
servants&hellip;. Surely Mr. Chamberlain does not think
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
we should regard such an inquiry as final. If he does, the sooner
his mind is disabused the better.&rdquo; Lord Stanley next discussed the
manner in which the Bradford Committee had made recommendations which
were based on no evidence whatever. For instance, in order to improve
the chances of promotion, the Committee had recommended the creation
of additional higher posts&mdash;&ldquo;for which there was no work.&rdquo; In
one Department of the Post Office that recommendation would mean the
increase in the number of overseers from 250 to 900. Lord Stanley
next made lengthy comparisons between the wages received by letter
sorters and telegraphists on the one hand, and employees of equal
intelligence and attainments in the service of private companies on the
other hand. He showed that in London the maximum wage of the sorters
and telegraphists was equal to the salary of the &ldquo;non-college-trained
certified teacher,&rdquo; and that in such provincial cities as Hull, Swansea
and Exeter it was larger. &ldquo;The only comparison which was not entirely
upon his [the Postmaster General&rsquo;s] side was that with the clerks in
the cable companies, who were paid more than the Post Office cable
room operators. But the work of the cable companies&rsquo; operators was
more arduous, and there was liability to be sent abroad at any moment.
But he had granted the Post Office cable room operators an increase of
pay.&rdquo; He added that the ultimate aggregate cost of the increases in
pay made since the publication of the Bradford Committee&rsquo;s Report would
be $642,000 a year.<a href="#Footnote_232_239" id="FNanchor_232_239" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Postmaster General applies the Terms &ldquo;Blackmail&rdquo; and
   &ldquo;Blood-sucking&rdquo;</em></div>

<p>Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, concluded as follows: &ldquo;But he
would ask the House just to consider what was going to be the end of
all these demands. This was really a question worthy of consideration
on both sides of the House. What were the demands on the public purse
for this particular office? It would be within the recollection of
the Committee of Supply that at a deputation to his Right Honorable
Friend and himself, one of the men stated that he thought the whole
of the $20,000,000 profit, as he regarded it, made by the Post Office
employees, ought to be devoted to the payment of those employees
&hellip; that man made a deliberate statement, not on his own account,
but as representing a particular section or organization in the
Department. It was repudiated by others present&hellip;.&rdquo; Lord Stanley
next stated that the demands made by the Post Office employees before
the Bradford Committee would have called for $12,500,000 a year. He
continued: &ldquo;Honorable Members knew better than he how they were being
bombarded with applications from Post Office employees and other
classes of Civil Servants for increases of wages. This had taken a
form which was not illegal, but which he could not help thinking was
an abuse of their rights, to wit, the form of a political threat. They
had circulated an appeal in which they expressed very clearly and very
frankly their intention, and it was one of which the Committee would
have to take note now, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
it would be much worse in the future. They said: &lsquo;Two-thirds at least
of one political party are in great fear of losing their seats. The
swing of the pendulum is against them, and any Member who receives 40
or 50 such letters will under present circumstances have to consider
very seriously whether on this question he can afford to go into the
wrong lobby. This is taking advantage of the political situation.&rsquo; It
was indeed, but it was abusing, as it seemed to him, their rights as
voters. It was nothing more nor less than blackmail. It was nothing
more nor less than asking Members to purchase votes for themselves at
the General Election<a href="#Footnote_233_240" id="FNanchor_233_240" class="fnanchor">233</a> at the expense of the Public Exchequer. Both
sides would have to make up their minds that some means should be
devised by which there should not be this continual blood-sucking on
the part of the public servants.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>A permanent non-political Tribunal suggested</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;How it was to be done, was not for him to say, but he had
suggested, and he still thought that there would have to be some
organization outside party politics altogether, and unconnected with
and unmoved by Parliament and political considerations, to whom such
questions should be referred and by whom an impartial opinion should be
given&hellip;. He wanted now rather to anticipate a request that would
probably be made by Honorable Members opposite&mdash;that he should
appoint a Parliamentary Committee. To that request he would have to
give a negative reply,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and he would say why. First, too great political pressure would be
brought to bear on the Committee; second, the whole case of the Post
Office employees was before the House in the evidence taken by the
Bradford Committee, and everybody could make up his mind as well as he
would be able to if appointed to a Select Committee. Third, he would
not throw the responsibility on to a Committee; it was his place to
bear it himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On July 18, Lord Stanley, Postmaster General, stated that he
would neither withdraw nor modify the epithets &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; and
&ldquo;blood-sucking&rdquo; which he had used. He stated that those epithets
applied &ldquo;only to those who by speeches, letters or circulars,
attempt unduly to influence the votes of Honorable Members with
regard to the questions affecting Post Office wages, and to those
who associate themselves with such action.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_234_241" id="FNanchor_234_241" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Captain Norton on Civil Service Agitation</em></div>

<p>After the Postmaster General had spoken, Captain Norton moved a
reduction of the Post Office Vote, for the purpose of drawing attention
to the grievances of long standing of the Post Office employees. He
said: &ldquo;As regarded what had been said about undue influence, his
contention was that so long as the Postal officials, or should he
say the members of the Civil Service, and for that matter the members
of the fighting services were allowed to maintain a vote, they had
precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the same rights as all other voters in the country to exercise their
fullest influence in the defense of their rights, privileges and
interests. He might mention that all classes of all communities, all
professions, all trades, all combinations of individuals, such as
anti-vaccinationists and so forth, had invariably used their utmost
pressure in defense of their interests and views upon Members of the
House&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_235_242" id="FNanchor_235_242" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>Sir Albert K. Rollit supported Captain Norton&rsquo;s motion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Chancellor of the Exchequer asks for non-Party Vote</em></div>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, spoke as
follows: &ldquo;The question at issue was not one between the two political
parties. It was above parties. It was whether there was to be good
economical government in the country at all, or whether the Civil
Servants in the employment of the Crown could make such use of their
votes, as citizens, for the purely selfish purpose of forcing the
public to pay more for their services and so increase the expenditure
of a great Department of State. He did not know how long they could
go on in the position they had now reached, under which pressure
was brought to bear on Honorable Members of all parties by their
constituents. He was certain that if any scheme could be devised
&hellip; so that they might take this question altogether out of the
region of political life&mdash;not merely out of party life, but out of
Parliamentary life&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
would be a great advantage. It would tend to preserve the Civil Service
free from that political influence and independent of the changing
fortunes of party which had been their great boast and security in
the past. If there were a general feeling in the House that an object
of that kind was one on which all parties might well co&ouml;perate,
then His Majesty&rsquo;s Government, while maintaining as resolutely as
they had in past years their objection to referring these specific
grievances to a Select Committee appointed in the ordinary way for that
particular purpose, would be prepared to assent to the appointment of
a Committee of this House to consider the state of affairs which had
arisen; to see if they could devise some remedy for it; to lay down the
principles by which they should be governed in these matters; and to
advise whether it would be possible to establish some permanent body
or Commission, outside the sphere of electoral pressure and above and
beyond any of our party conflicts, which might advise the Government
in applying those principles to particular cases. Such a Committee
could, of course, only be successfully conceded with the good will of
all parties in the House, and if the whole House were animated by a
desire, if possible, to set this question at rest. With that good-will,
he thought, it might serve a useful purpose. The object to be attained
was of such vast importance that he, for one, would not refuse any
method by which they might hope successfully to compass it and to
maintain the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Civil Service in that high position of which, with its great
traditions, they had such just cause to be proud and such good reason
to be grateful for.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_236_243" id="FNanchor_236_243" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>Captain Norton&rsquo;s motion was lost by a vote of 249 to 205. The House
divided on party lines, only two Members of the Opposition voting with
the Government, and only nine supporters of the Government voting
with the Opposition.<a href="#Footnote_237_244" id="FNanchor_237_244" class="fnanchor">237</a> Of the Members of the Opposition who
voted in support of Captain Norton&rsquo;s motion, two shortly afterward
became members of the Cabinet in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&rsquo;s
Liberal Ministry, and fifteen others became members of the Ministry,
but not of the Cabinet, or inner circle.<a href="#Footnote_238_245" id="FNanchor_238_245" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Norton himself became one of the four Junior Lords of
the Treasury. The latter functionaries &ldquo;are expected to gather the
greatest number of their own party into every division [of the
House of Commons], and by persuasion, promises, explanation, and
every available expedient, to bring their men from all quarters
to the aid of the Government upon any emergency. It is also their
business to conciliate the discontented and doubtful among the
ministerial supporters, and to keep every one, as far as possible,
in good humor.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_239_246" id="FNanchor_239_246" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In <cite>The Nineteenth Century and After</cite>, for April, 1906, Mr. J.
H. Heaton, in an article entitled: <cite>Wanted! An End to Political
Patronage</cite>, discussed at length some of the after effects of the
memorable debate of July 6, 1905. Mr. Heaton had been returned to
Parliament from Canterbury in 1885, 1886, 1892, 1895, and 1900; the
last four occasions as an unopposed candidate. He had carried the
Imperial Penny Postage Scheme in 1888; he had introduced telegraph
money orders in England; the parcel post to France, etc.; and the
freedom of the City of London in a gold casket had been conferred on
him in 1899.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A Prime Minister on the Civil Service</em></div>

<p>Mr. Heaton opened his article with the statement: &ldquo;Many years ago a
great Prime Minister wrote to me as follows: &lsquo;There can be no doubt
that the organized attempts of servants of the State to use their
political influence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
at the cost of the taxpayer is likely to become a serious danger.
I agree with you in thinking that it can only be effectually met
by agreement between the two sides of the House.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Heaton
continued: &ldquo;The Civil Servants of the Crown are, taken as a whole,
an admirable and efficient body of workers, of whom England is
justifiably proud, and whom&mdash;as was held, I think, by the late
Mr. Gladstone&mdash;she rewards on a generous scale&hellip;. It is the
more to be regretted that large classes of them should have fallen into
the hands of agitators, who incite to the systematic intimidation of
Members of Parliament with a view to the extortion of larger and larger
votes [appropriations] for salaries. This evil is rapidly becoming
formidable&hellip;. Any official raising the cry of &lsquo;higher wages&rsquo; is
sure of popularity among his fellows, who instantly regard him as a
born leader. The pleasant prospect of an increase of income without
working for it is a bait that never fails to appeal most strongly to
the least energetic and deserving. A postman or dockyard hand finds
that he can win promotion and increased pay only by strenuous hard
work, just as if he were a mere artisan or shop assistant. But the
agitators point out that he can attain an equivalent result by bullying
the local M. P., and so he joins the league or union formed for the
purpose.&rdquo;</p>

   <em>Sir William Harcourt on Post Office Employees</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;Where is this to stop? The late Sir W. Harcourt<a href="#Footnote_240_247" id="FNanchor_240_247" class="fnanchor">240</a>
wrote (to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
me) that the demands of the Postal employees reached a depth, or abyss,
which no plummet would fathom. We know now that they claim the Postal
surplus, which amounts to nearly five millions [sterling]&hellip;.
There are 192,000 of them, and of these probably 100,000 have votes.
Adding these to the dockyard, arsenal, and stores factory hands, and
other Government employees, we have a political force that may turn the
scale at a General Election. Candidates are tempted to bid against one
another with the taxpayer&rsquo;s money. &lsquo;Let us be charitable!&rsquo; said Sydney
Smith, and put his hand into a bystander&rsquo;s pocket. Our legislators were
proof against the hectoring of the Tudors, the violence of the Stuarts,
and the blandishments of the Georges; surely they will never yield to
the menaces of demagogues.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Thirty M. P.&rsquo;s threatened with Loss of Seat</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;At this point I would like to state briefly my own
experience&hellip;. Last year great pressure was brought to bear in
the House of Commons on Members of Parliament, and, with thirty other
Members, I was threatened with the loss of my seat unless I voted to
meet the demands of the Postal servants. It was further intimated to
me that the Postal servants&rsquo; vote, 100,000 strong, would turn out any
Government. A few minutes afterwards it fell to my lot to address the
House on the question of increase of postmen&rsquo;s wages&hellip;. I ended
my speech by declaring that civil servants who threatened Members of
Parliament for refusing to vote them increased
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
salaries ought to be disfranchised. Result&mdash;a meeting called in my
constituency, my opponent placed in the chair, and a vote of censure
passed on me. The London postmen came to Canterbury and addressed my
constituents at the meeting. It is not surprising, therefore, that
at the recent election my agents informed me that 46 postmen voted
solid against me.<a href="#Footnote_241_248" id="FNanchor_241_248" class="fnanchor">241</a> I do not blame the postmen; they were
perfectly justified in using their power; but if I had not had at my
back one of the most intelligent bodies of electors in the United
Kingdom, I should have been defeated through the postmen&rsquo;s action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was some consolation to me to receive in the House of
Commons, after my speech, hearty, though private, congratulations
from hard-working, earnest workingmen representatives, who expressed
their entire approval of what they were pleased to call my courage.
But something ought to be done to prevent a recurrence of such a
scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In view of Mr. Heaton&rsquo;s closing remarks, it is interesting to note
that four of the eight<a href="#Footnote_242_249" id="FNanchor_242_249" class="fnanchor">242</a> Labor Members voted, and that all of them
favored the appointment of a House of Commons Select Committee.</p>

   <em>Post Office Employees and the General Election of 1906</em></div>

<p>In the campaign preceding the General Election of January, 1906, the
several associations of Postal and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Telegraph employees addressed letters to the candidates for Parliament,
asking those candidates whether they would &ldquo;support the claims of the
Postal and Telegraph employees and vote for the appointment of a Select
Committee of the House of Commons for the purpose of inquiring into
their conditions of pay and service; and stating that on their part
the workers pledged themselves to accept as final the decision of such
a tribunal.&rdquo; At the annual conference of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo;
Association, held in March, 1906, the President of the Association
said that nearly 450 of the 670 Members of the House of Commons<a href="#Footnote_243_250" id="FNanchor_243_250" class="fnanchor">243</a>
had pledged themselves to support a motion for a Parliamentary Inquiry
into the position of the Post Office employees.<a href="#Footnote_244_251" id="FNanchor_244_251" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>In the third sitting of the new Parliament, held on February 20, the
Postmaster General, Mr. Sydney Buxton, announced that the Government
had decided to appoint a Select Committee of the House of Commons.<a href="#Footnote_245_252" id="FNanchor_245_252" class="fnanchor">245</a>
And on March 6, the Postmaster General introduced a motion for a
Committee of seven to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.
In response to the wishes of the House, the Postmaster General
subsequently changed his motion to one calling for a Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of nine, to be appointed by the whips of the several parties
in the House.<a href="#Footnote_246_253" id="FNanchor_246_253" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Prime Minister on Election Pledges</em></div>

<p>The motion was carried without debate upon the question whether a
Committee should be appointed. In the course of the debate whether
the Committee should be appointed by the Committee of Selection,
or by the Party Whips, Lord Balcarres, who had been a Junior Lord
of the Treasury in the Balfour Government, used these words: &ldquo;As
regards those Honorable Gentlemen who had entered Parliament for
the first time,<a href="#Footnote_247_254" id="FNanchor_247_254" class="fnanchor">247</a> he thought he was fairly accurate when he
said that they had given pretty specific pledges upon the matter [of
the appointment of a Select Committee] to those who had sent them to
the House.&rdquo; Sir A. Acland-Hood, who had been Chief Whip and Patronage
Secretary to the Treasury in the late Balfour Government, said: &ldquo;There
was a debate and a division [upon this question, last year,] and
nearly the whole of the supporters of the Government voted against
the appointment of the Committee. No doubt many of them suffered for
it at the General Election; they either lost their seats or had their
majorities reduced in consequence of the vote.&rdquo; And, finally, Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, the new Prime Minister, expressed himself as
follows in the course of an argument in favor of a Committee appointed
by the Committee of Selection
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
rather than by the House itself through the agency of the Party Whips.
The Prime Minister said: &ldquo;There was a great deal of force in what the
Right Honorable Gentleman [Sir A. Acland-Hood] had said as to the fears
that were entertained in many quarters of the effect on the Committee
if appointed under pressure and insistence, and the retroactive effect
of old promises extracted in moments of agony from candidates at the
General Election.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_248_255" id="FNanchor_248_255" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>The Select Committee on Post Office Servants consists of: 4
Liberals, Messrs. Barker, Edwards, Hobhouse and Sutherland; 2
Conservatives, the Honorable Claude Hay and Sir Clement Hill; 2
Liberal and Labor Members, Messrs. John Ward and G. J. Wardle;
and 1 Nationalist, Mr. P. A. Meechan.<a href="#Footnote_249_256" id="FNanchor_249_256" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p>The reference to the Committee is: &ldquo;to inquire into the wages and
position of the principal classes of Post Office servants, and also of
the unestablished postmasters. To examine, so far as may be necessary
for the purpose of their Report, the conditions of employment of these
classes. To report, whether, having regard to the conditions and
prospects of their employment, and, as far as may be, to the standard
rate of wages and the position of other classes of workers, the
remuneration they receive is adequate or otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the spring of 1907, the Committee reported that it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
had not had time to perform its task, and asked for reappointment. The
evidence thus far taken by the Committee had not been published at the
date of this writing, March 20, 1907.</p>

<p>Lord Stanley was one of the many Conservative candidates defeated in
the General Election of January, 1906. When his defeat became known,
hundreds of telegrams were showered upon him by postal and telegraph
employees located in all parts of the United Kingdom. The telegram sent
by Liverpool postal and telegraph employees was typical of the lot. It
congratulated Lord Stanley upon his retirement to private life, and
assured him that the senders at all times would do all in their power

   CHAPTER XIV <br /><span class="smcap">The House of Commons,
   Under Pressure from the Civil Service Unions, Curtails the
   Executive&rsquo;s Power to Dismiss Incompetent and Redundant
   Employees</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The old practice of intervention by Members of Parliament
   on behalf of individual civil servants with political
   influence has given way to the new practice of intervention
   on behalf of the individual civil servant because he is a
   member of a civil service union. The new practice is the more
   insidious and dangerous one, for it means class bribery.
   The doctrine that entrance upon the State&rsquo;s service means
   &ldquo;something very nearly approaching to a freehold provision for
   life.&rdquo; Official testimony of various prominent civil servants,
   especially of Mr. (now Lord) Welby, Permanent Secretary
   to the Treasury from 1885 to 1894; and Mr. T. H. Farrer,
   Permanent Secretary to Board of Trade from 1867 to 1886.
   The costly practice of giving pensions no solution of the
   problem of getting rid of unsatisfactory public servants. The
   difficulty of dismissing incompetent persons extends even to
   probationers. The cost of &ldquo;reorganizing&rdquo; incompetent persons
   out of the public service.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Personal Bribery replaced by Class Bribery</em></div>

<p>The intervention of the House of Commons in the details of the
administration of the Post Office Department and the other State
Departments, is by no means confined to the raising of salaries and
wages. It extends to practically every kind of question that arises out
of the conflicts of the interests of the State servants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and the interests of the public Treasury. The intervention is due to
the organized action of the &ldquo;civil service unions;&rdquo; and it is exercised
primarily on behalf of classes of employees, but not exclusively. The
latter day spirit of the civil service unions is to make the cause
of the individual the cause of the class, and that brings about much
intervention through the House of Commons, by the organized civil
service, on behalf of individual State servants. The ancient form of
intervention on behalf of the individual who had claims that were
based on personal influence or family influence, on family ties, or
on friendship, has been abolished. In its place has been developed
intervention on behalf of the individual, prompted by the fact that
the individual in question is a member of a civil service union that
seeks to enforce certain ideals as to the terms and conditions that
shall prevail in the public service. Of the two forms of intervention,
the latter is the more pernicious and demoralizing, partly because
it is&mdash;or will become&mdash;more pervasive, partly because it
rests on class bribery and class corruption, as distinguished from the
individual bribery and the individual corruption upon which rested the
old form of intervention. Of those two forms of corruption, the bribery
of classes is the more difficult to eradicate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>State Employment means Life Employment</em></div>

<p>One of the most important results of this intervention on behalf of
individuals has been the establishment of the doctrine that once a man
has landed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
employ of the State, he has &ldquo;something very nearly approaching
to a freehold of provision for life,&rdquo; to employ the words of
the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Civil Services
Expenditure, 1873.<a href="#Footnote_250_257" id="FNanchor_250_257" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>Before that committee, Sir Wm. H. Stephenson, Chairman of the
Inland Revenue Commissioners, said: &ldquo;&hellip;if a man was reported
to be hopelessly inefficient, I should dismiss him; but even then you
must act with a great deal of forbearance. For the simple reason that
you are amenable to many opinions beside your own. You cannot act
absolutely upon your own judgment without being liable to be compelled
to give your reasons for that judgment; and these reasons, though
perfectly clear in your own mind, may not always be easy to give to
the satisfaction of another man&hellip;. I am afraid we should have a
very bad time of it out of doors if we exercised a little more freedom
in dismissing incompetent clerks and promoting deserving ones; I judge
very much by what I see; as it is, there is a great disposition, I
think, to exclaim against anything like an act of tyranny, and the
exercise of such freedom would be called tyranny&hellip;. I have no
doubt that if a public department had the power of absolute dismissal,
it would have a considerable effect in increasing efficiency; but what
I say is, that you cannot give them that power in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
way that it is held by a man in private employment. You have too many
critics; you have the public newspaper press; you have Members of the
House of Commons who are personally interested in these people; and you
would be surprised, I am sure, if you knew the numerous instances in
which, for the smallest thing [inflictions of punishment], applications
are made, pressing that this man is an excellent man, a good brother,
a kind father, and all that kind of thing which influences men
individually, but which cannot [does, but should not] influence the
judgment of the heads of a public office.&rdquo; Sir William H. Stephenson
was asked: &ldquo;Do you not think that it might be made a rule in your
office, as in the Customs, that any interference through a Member of
Parliament should lead to dismissal?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Yes; but you must
prove that a man knows it. You cannot dismiss a man if some injudicious
friend takes up his case; and if a man has a friend, it is always an
injudicious one under these circumstances.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_251_258" id="FNanchor_251_258" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>Before this same committee of 1873, Mr. Stanfeld, M. P., Third Lord
of the Treasury, who, in 1869 to 1871 had been Financial Secretary to
the Treasury, said: &ldquo;&hellip;the great difference between the public
establishment and the private establishment is this: that practically
speaking, in a public establishment, you have a large proportion of
established clerks who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
can do no more than a moderate amount of service&hellip;. Because
you have not the faculty which men in private business have, without
any particular fault, of saying to a man: &lsquo;On the whole, you do not
suit me, and I mean to get somebody else.&rsquo; When you get a clerk on a
public establishment, he remains on that establishment with very rare
exceptions, and you have to make the best of your bargain; the result
naturally is that, with the exception of men of ability and energy,
you have not so much stimulus for their effort as you have in private
employment, and you have not by any means the same power of dealing
with them.&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_252_259" id="FNanchor_252_259" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>In 1888, before the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into
the Civil Establishments, this question of the great difficulty of
getting rid of incompetent or undesirable men, was threshed out at
great length. Sir Charles DuCane, Chairman of the Commissioners of
Customs, said: &ldquo;But it is an invidious thing, I do not mean to say as
regards myself, but invidious rather as regards the [political] head
of a department [the Minister], to come and make complaints against
men whom one cannot perhaps accuse of any overt act of negligence or
carelessness, but who are merely rather below the level of ordinary
efficiency&hellip;. I think it would be a most desirable thing that we
should have the power of getting rid of incapable and inefficient men
who have yet managed to keep themselves out of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
any positive scrape or offence, for which they would be
charged before a Member of the Board of Commissioners of
Customs.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_253_260" id="FNanchor_253_260" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>To Sir S. A. Blackwood, Secretary to the Post Office since 1880, the
Chairman of the Royal Commission put the question: &ldquo;Do you think it is
a real evil in the public service that there should not be the same
power to remove inefficient men as exists outside the public service,
of course I mean within certain limits, because the public service must
be different from private service, but in your experience, have you
found it to be a real evil in the way of efficiency as well as of wise
economy to be obliged to keep men whom you would be glad to get rid of
if you could have sent them away with something in their pocket, [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.
e.</span>, a pension]?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;Yes, it is a serious objection.&rdquo;
Sir S. A. Blackwood even asserted that the Act of 1887, giving the
Treasury discretionary power to pension men unable to discharge
efficiently the duties of their office,<a href="#Footnote_254_261" id="FNanchor_254_261" class="fnanchor">254</a> would not help much.
&ldquo;We should always be asking an officer to relinquish his full pay, and
to retire upon a lesser pension than he would be entitled to if he
served his full time, and there is always a disinclination
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
on the part of heads of departments to do that.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_255_262" id="FNanchor_255_262" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>Sir Reginald E. Welby, who had entered the Treasury service in
1856, and had been made Permanent Secretary in 1885, said there was
full power to dismiss idle or incompetent persons without granting
pensions or allowances of any sort. Thereupon, Mr. F. Mitford, one of
the Members of the Royal Commission, asked: &ldquo;Is not really the sole
difficulty that public departments have to contend with in exercising
that full power, the fact that Parliament is behind them, and a
Member of Parliament always asks questions [in the House] and brings
interest [pressure] to bear upon the head of the department, which
practically annuls that power? The difficulty lies not with the public
officer, but practically with the difficulties that are thrown in his
way outside his department by individual Members of Parliament?&rdquo; The
Permanent Secretary of the Treasury answered: &ldquo;There is always before
the heads of departments the fact that pressure may be brought to bear
by Members of Parliament, and it requires, therefore, that a case must
be very strong, that it must be a very good case before you would
dismiss. Probably you would be much more long-suffering in a Government
department, than you would be in a private establishment.&rdquo; Sir
Reginald Welby just previously had said: &ldquo;I have known men dismissed
from the Treasury&hellip;. Perhaps I had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
better say, I have heard of men being dismissed from the Treasury for
simple idleness, but it was before my time.&rdquo; Thereupon the Chairman
had queried: &ldquo;It is the fact, speaking generally, is it not, that
mere idleness and mere incompetence, without very gross negligence of
duty or gross misbehavior, does not bring about dismissal from the
service, either in the Treasury or anywhere else that you are aware
of?&rdquo; The reply was: &ldquo;I would rather put it in this way: I think that
Government offices are very long-suffering in that matter. If the man
was reported as distinctly very idle and not doing his work he would
be warned, and I think if it was repeated after that (I am speaking of
any fairly managed Government department), he would be dismissed. But I
think that a Government department is, for one reason or another, more
long-suffering than a private establishment would be&hellip;. While
I am admitting the possibility of there being bad officers, I should
like to add that both in the Upper and Lower Division Clerks, we have
got, on the whole, a very satisfactory set of men under the present
regulations of the Treasury, and that they do their work well. I am
happy to say that very few cases of complaint come before me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The House of Commons is Master</em></div>

<p>Mr. Lawson, a member of the Royal Commission, asked Sir Reginald
Welby: &ldquo;But you would hardly plead the interference of Members of
Parliament as a justification for not getting rid of an unworthy
servant, would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
you?&rdquo; Sir Reginald Welby replied: &ldquo;It is not a good reason, but
as a matter of fact it is powerful. The House of Commons are
our masters.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_256_263" id="FNanchor_256_263" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>Sir T. H. Farrer, who had been Permanent Secretary of the Board
of Trade from 1867 to 1886, and had been a Member of the so-called
Playfair Commission, of 1876, on the Civil Service, was asked by Mr.
R. W. Hanbury, a Member of the Royal Commission of 1888, whether the
failure to dismiss incompetent men could not be attributed to &ldquo;soft
heartedness&rdquo; on the part of heads of departments? Sir T. H. Farrer
replied: &ldquo;Yes, that is another aspect of the case, and it is no doubt
theoretically perfectly true; but I think it overlooks what is the
real difficulty of getting rid of useless men. There is a certain
difficulty in the soft heartedness of heads of departments and of
Ministers. But there is a very much greater difficulty in the pressure
which is put upon them by Members of the House of Commons. That is the
real difficulty; the real difficulty of the public service is getting
rid of bad men; and the real difficulty of getting rid of bad men is
that no Minister will face the pressure which is put upon him from
outside&hellip;. I have had much personal experience of the matter; I
have been plagued all my life at the Board of Trade with inefficient
men that I wanted to get rid of, but have been unable to do so&hellip;.
Parliamentary pressure is the main difficulty&hellip;.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Members are economical in general [protestations]; but in particular
cases they think more of their constituents than of the public service.
No doubt with a little thinking I could recall a very great number of
instances, but two or three occur to me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>You may dismiss but you must not</em></div>

<p>&ldquo;Not very many years ago there was a clerk of whom perpetual
complaints were made to me. He was in a hard-worked department, and
the heads of it told me repeatedly: &lsquo;We can do nothing with him.&rsquo; At
last we got it arranged that he should go [with a large pension, on
the theory that his office was abolished, because no longer required].
My back was turned&mdash;I was away on a holiday&mdash;and when I came
back, I found that Parliamentary pressure, by which I mean applications
from Members, had been put on, and in spite of us all, the man was back
in the place to the detriment of our credit. Let me mention another
case. I was engaged upon a reorganization of the department under
one of the strongest men [Ministers] I have ever served. What the
President of the Board of Trade said to me, in effect was: &lsquo;We must
have new blood; we are getting crowded up with effete men; I will back
you in anything you do, only you must undertake not to get me into a
difficulty in the House of Commons. I cannot afford it; the Government
cannot afford time for it; they cannot afford strength to fight
battles of that kind.&rsquo; We set to work about the reorganization with our
hands tied, and we were obliged to say to these men: &lsquo;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
if you stay here, we will make it very uncomfortable for you; we will
put you in the very worst places in the office,&rsquo; The Treasury offered
good terms of retirement [pensions], and in that way, after a good
deal of fighting, we got rid of most of them&hellip;. We had to give
them very high terms [that is, very liberal pensions]. I may mention a
case which happened even since then. I refer to the official Receivers
in Bankruptcy. They were men who were appointed only a few years
ago, under the most stringent conditions imposed by the Treasury and
the Board of Trade, and without the slightest reference to personal
considerations or to politics. They were told that they were appointed
on trial, that they might be removed at any moment if the Board of
Trade desired it for the good of the service. Fortunately, most of them
have turned out extremely well. One, perhaps more, turned out bad, but
one certainly turned out very bad. Perpetual complaints were made to
me by the head of that department that he could do nothing with this
man, and that the business was being badly conducted. After a good
deal of trouble, after I left, it was determined to remove this man.
The Members of Parliament for the county, as I am told, came and put
pressure upon the President of the Board of Trade [the Minister], till
he was obliged to say: &lsquo;I cannot remove him; he must stay.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Pension System no Remedy</em></div>

<p>To the foregoing testimony from the Permanent Secretary of the Board
of Trade, the Chairman of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Royal Commission replied: &ldquo;I gather from what you say, that,
supposing it was possible, under this new system of pensions and
allowances, to give a man who was sent away from the service the
money which he had himself contributed toward his ultimate pension,
either with or without the addition of a Government grant, you do
not think that would get over the difficulty in getting rid of
incompetent men?&rdquo; Sir T. H. Farrer replied: &ldquo;No, I do not think it
would, unless the House of Commons passes a self-denying ordinance,
and refuses to interfere with the Ministers in the management of
their departments.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_257_264" id="FNanchor_257_264" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Later in the examination, Lord Lingen, who had been Permanent
Secretary of the Treasury from 1869 to 1885, said to Sir T. H. Farrer:
&ldquo;You have given a good deal of evidence as to the difficulties which
the relation of the public departments to Parliament creates. I think
we might hold there is nothing in private service analogous to what you
may call the triennial change of Government, that [when] everybody who
has been passed over [not promoted], who thinks he has any grievance,
considers that he has a fresh chance on a change of Ministry?&rdquo; The
Secretary of the Board of Trade replied: &ldquo;Yes, I remember distinctly
one particular case in which on every change of Government a fresh
appeal was made to the new Ministers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
on behalf of men who had been retired for good reasons.&rdquo; Lord Lingen
continued: &ldquo;It revived questions which had been supposed to be
settled?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it does, not infrequently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On August 1, 1890, in the House of Commons, the Postmaster
General, Mr. Raikes, in speaking of a Post Office employee who had
been disciplined, said: &ldquo;The case is one to which I have given a
great deal of personal attention; indeed, I may say that in cases
of dismissal or punishment I have always endeavored to satisfy
myself thoroughly as to the facts, and to mitigate, if I can, the
effect of the regulations of the Department.&rdquo; On that same day
the Postmaster General stated&mdash;in reply to Mr. Conybeare,<a href="#Footnote_258_265" id="FNanchor_258_265" class="fnanchor">258</a>
who was intervening on behalf of one Cornwell, dismissed from the
postal service&mdash;that Cornwell had been dismissed for the second
time. After the first dismissal, the Postmaster General himself had
reinstated Cornwell. The second dismissal had been necessary &ldquo;in the
interest of the Service at large, but especially in that of the other
men employed on the same duty, his case should be dealt with in an
exemplary manner.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_259_266" id="FNanchor_259_266" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>In March, 1896, the Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on
Post Office Establishments, asked Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary
General
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Post Office: &ldquo;Do you think there is any other particular class of
employment which is comparable with that of the postmen?&rdquo; Mr. Hill
replied: &ldquo;I thought of railway servants, whose work in many ways
resembles the work of our employees. If they have not the same
permanence as our people have, they have continuous employment
so long as they are efficient, but our people have continuous
employment whether they are efficient or not.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_260_267" id="FNanchor_260_267" class="fnanchor">260</a> Several months
later, Mr. Hill testified as follows before this same Committee:
&ldquo;Our inquiries have proved that the telegraph staff at Liverpool
is excessive, and it has been decided, on vacancies [occurring],
to abolish the ten appointments.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_261_268" id="FNanchor_261_268" class="fnanchor">261</a> The meaning of this
statement is, that if a mistake is made, and too many men are appointed
to a certain office; or, if the business of an office falls off, the
Government cannot correct the redundancy of employees by dismissing, or
by transferring to some other office, the redundant employees. It must
wait until promotion, retirement on account of old age, or death shall
remove the redundant employees. Before this same committee, Mr. J. C.
Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, testified that in theory
there were no first class letter sorters in the foreign newspaper
department of the London Post Office, since there had been, since 1886,
no work that called for first class newspaper sorters.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
But as a matter of fact there were thirty-seven &ldquo;redundant first
class sorters, who, upon resignation, or pensioning, or death,
would be replaced by second class sorters.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_262_269" id="FNanchor_262_269" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>In 1902, Sir Edgar Vincent,<a href="#Footnote_263_270" id="FNanchor_263_270" class="fnanchor">263</a> a Member of the
Select Committee on National Expenditure, 1902, asked Lord Welby,
who had been Permanent Secretary to the Treasury from 1885 to 1894:
&ldquo;It is, I presume, extremely difficult for the Minister at the head
of a Department to dismiss, or place on the retired list incompetent
officers?&rdquo; Lord Welby replied: &ldquo;It is very difficult. Of course there
are different degrees of incompetency. It is not so difficult in the
case of a notoriously incompetent officer, but there are many people,
as the honorable Member is aware, against whom nothing whatever can
be said, who are still the very reverse of competent.&rdquo; Sir Edgar
Vincent continued: &ldquo;Can you suggest any means of substituting for a
Minister whom it is almost impossible to expect to perform the duty,
some authority who should revise Establishments and exclude the bad
bargains?&rdquo; Lord Welby, of course, replied that the remedy suggested
would be inconsistent with the principles of parliamentary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
government,<a href="#Footnote_264_271" id="FNanchor_264_271" class="fnanchor">264</a> in that it would substitute for the Minister,
who holds office at the pleasure of the House of Commons, some
permanent officer or officers appointed by the Ministry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficult to dismiss Probationers</em></div>

<p>Oftentimes the difficulty experienced in dismissing unsatisfactory
public servants, extends even to persons appointed on probation.</p>

<p>In April, 1875, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the course
of the Financial Statement, said: &ldquo;We now appoint young men upon
probation, and the understanding of that probationary employment is
that if the person is found after six months or a year to be unfit,
he is told that he must look elsewhere. This is a very invidious
duty for the head of an office to perform, and it is very often
not performed.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_265_272" id="FNanchor_265_272" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>In 1888, Mr. Harvey, a Member of the Royal Commission on the Civil
Establishments, said: &ldquo;The tendency in a Government office is for
the man to regard his probationary period as practically a &lsquo;<span
lang="la" xml:lang="la">nominis umbra</span>&rsquo; [the mere shadow of a name],
nothing else.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_266_273" id="FNanchor_266_273"
class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>The Chairman of the Royal Commission of 1888 asked Sir Reginald
Welby, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury: &ldquo;Is there anything like
a real probation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
in any one of the divisions of the clerks at the Treasury, so that you
can find out [whether they are likely to prove competent]?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I
think so. The principal clerk of the division to which the probationer
is attached makes a report at the end of six months; and I have known a
principal clerk to make a doubtful report. In that case, if I remember
rightly, the term of probation was extended.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_267_274"
id="FNanchor_267_274" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>The boys employed by the Post Office Department for the delivery
of telegrams, are, in a way, on continuous probation. If they serve
satisfactorily, they are, at the age of 16, taken in training for the
position of postmen. In 1897, Mr. Lewin Hill, Assistant Secretary
General Post Office, said: &ldquo;&hellip;in London, in the past, the
weeding out of messenger boys at 16 years has not been carried out
so far, I think, owing to the paternal feelings of the Department.
Every effort seems to have been made to keep in the service anybody
who could possibly scrape through. But the country postmasters were,
as a rule, careful to weed out unsatisfactory lads.&rdquo; He continued:
&ldquo;&hellip;We could have got better postmen [in London], if we had
had a free hand.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_268_275" id="FNanchor_268_275"
class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1857 the opposition made in Parliament to the system of pensions,
led to the appointment of a Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
to inquire into the operation of the Superannuation Act, 1834.
That Committee stated as follows the argument &ldquo;from the public
point of view&rdquo; in favor of pensions. &ldquo;Though it is strictly the
duty of heads of departments to remove from the public service
all those who have become unfit to discharge their duties, yet
experience shows that this duty cannot be enforced. It is felt to be
hard&mdash;and even unjust&mdash;and inefficient men are, therefore,
retained in the Service to the detriment of efficiency. They,
therefore, were unhesitatingly of opinion that the public interest
would be best consulted by maintaining a system of superannuation
allowances.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_269_276" id="FNanchor_269_276" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>In accordance with the foregoing recommendation Parliament, in
1859, enacted that the Treasury might give &ldquo;abolition terms&rdquo; to
persons whose offices should be abolished in consequence of the
&ldquo;reorganization&rdquo; of their department, or branch of service. Under that
Act, inefficient persons who are &ldquo;reorganized out of the service&rdquo;
are given &ldquo;pro rata&rdquo; pensions, plus an allowance for &ldquo;abolition of
their office.&rdquo; For example, a man aged 50, with 30 years of service,
who would become entitled to a pension at the age of 60, will be
retired at 50 years, with a pro rata pension on the basis of 30 years&rsquo;
service, plus an allowance of 7 or 10 years&rsquo; service for abolition
of his office.<a href="#Footnote_270_277" id="FNanchor_270_277" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cost of Pensions to the Incompetent</em></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure,
Sir William H. Stephenson, Chairman of the Commissioners of Inland
Revenue, illustrated the working of this system with the statement
that in 1873-74, the salaries paid in the Inland Revenue Department
would aggregate $4,808,580. An additional $683,160 would be required
for pensions; and a further $234,175 would be required on account of
the abolition terms given to men who had been reorganized out of the
Inland Revenue Department. Thus the &ldquo;non-effective,&rdquo; or non-revenue
producing, charges of the department were equivalent to 19 per cent. of
the effective, or revenue producing, charges.<a href="#Footnote_271_278" id="FNanchor_271_278" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>In 1888 the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the Civil
Establishments reported that the burden on the State for pensions was
equivalent to 12 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the working salaries,
and that the payment of the abolition terms raised the percentage in
question to 20 per cent. of the working salaries. Sir Reginald E.
Welby, Secretary to the Treasury, stated before the Commission, that
even the past liberal expenditure on account of pro rata pensions with
abolition terms, had not enabled the State to get rid of &ldquo;inefficient
and incapable men.&rdquo; The Chairman of the Royal Commission spoke of the
abolition terms as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
amounting &ldquo;almost to a scandal.&rdquo; Sir R. E. Welby and Lord Lingen, a
former Secretary to the Treasury, contrasted the State&rsquo;s system of
pensions with the system of the London and North Western Railway. The
Railway&rsquo;s pension system was maintained out of a fund raised by a 2.5
per cent. reduction from the salaries of the employees, and a 2.5 per
cent. contribution from the treasury of the railway.</p>

<p>Sir R. E. Welby, Secretary to the Treasury, and other witnesses,
spoke of the abolition terms often acting as a premium on inefficiency.
Mr. Robert Giffen, the eminent statistician and political economist,
who also was an officer of the Board of Trade, said: &ldquo;When a man is
reorganized out of the service, as a rule he gets so many years&rsquo;
service added [to his actual service], that is to say, at 50 years, if
he has served 30 years, he may have 7 or 10 years&rsquo; service added, and
thus get two-thirds of his salary as a pension; and he begins to get
his pension at once, instead of waiting until he is 60 years of age. A
man who thus gets a pension at 50 years, really gets more than double
what he would get if he waited until 60 years of age. The present value
of $100 a year, beginning at once at the age of 50 years, is a good
deal more than double the present value of $100 a year to be paid to a
man when he reaches 60 years. The difference in favor of the man who
is reorganized out of the service, as against the man who remains until
he is 60 years of age, is simply overwhelming to my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Algernon E. West, Chairman of the Inland Revenue Commissioners,
illustrated the working of the practice of getting rid of inefficient
men by reorganizing an office, by citing the following instance of
&ldquo;successful&rdquo; reorganization. Sir Algernon West had retired 39 upper
division clerks, permanently reducing the number of the staff by 39.
He had thus effected a saving in salaries of $70,000 a year. But he
had incurred an annual expenditure of $44,160 on account of pensions,
and an annual expenditure of $10,000 on account of abolition terms.
Therefore his net saving was not $70,000 but only $15,840. Yet Sir
Algernon West denominated his reorganization successful.</p>

<p>In the course of this reorganization, Sir Algernon West
had increased the hours of work from 6 hours to 7 hours. The
reorganization, also, had necessitated certain promotions. Sir Algernon
had made it a condition of promotion, that the man promoted should
consent to work 7 hours a day. Men not promoted he gave $150 a year
&ldquo;as a personal allowance in consideration of the extra hour they were
called to serve.&rdquo; One man, aged 34 years, declined to work more than 6
hours on any terms, saying that the Government had made a contract with
him for six hours&rsquo; work a day. In order to get rid of this man, Sir
Algernon West gave him a pension on the basis of 10 years&rsquo; service.
Legally, of course, the man had no claim to any pension or abolition
allowance whatever, for he was in

   CHAPTER XV <br /><span class="smcap">The House of Commons,
   Under Pressure from the Civil Service Unions, Curtails
   the Executive&rsquo;s Power to Promote Employees According to
   Merit</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The civil service unions oppose promotion by merit, and
   demand promotion by seniority. Testimony presented before:
   Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873; Select
   Committee on Post Office, 1876; Royal Commission to inquire
   into the Civil Establishments, 1888; from statement made in
   House of Commons, in 1887, by Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General;
   and before the so-called Tweedmouth Committee, 1897. Instances
   of intervention by Members of House of Commons on behalf of
   civil servants who have not been promoted, or are afraid they
   shall not be promoted.</p>
</div>

<p>In the matter of promotion, also, the civil servants&rsquo; unions compel
the Members of Parliament to intervene, on behalf of individual
employees, in the details of the administration of the several
Departments of State. The organized civil service is not content that
every man should have an equal chance of promotion, so far as his
industry and capacity shall qualify him for advancement; it evinces
a marked tendency to demand equal promotion in fact, that is, the
elimination of the effects of the natural inequality among men. The
House of Commons, in yielding in this matter to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the pressure from the organized civil service, is tending to reduce the
public service to a dull level of mediocrity, which action at one and
the same time impairs the efficiency of the public service and makes
the service of the State unattractive to able and ambitious men.</p>

<p>In this matter of promotion, the permanent heads of the Departments
are hampered also by the unbusinesslike attitude toward the conduct of
the public business that characterizes large sections of the newspaper
press as well the great mass of the voters. That unbusinesslike frame
of mind, in turn, is the outgrowth of that untrained sympathy which
makes every one tend to sympathize with the individual, whenever
the interest of the individual clashes with that of the State. To
illustrate, in 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services
Expenditure, Sir William H. Stephenson, Chairman of the Commissioners
of Inland Revenue, stated that in his Department promotion was mainly
by seniority in the two lowest classes, to some extent by seniority in
the third class, but beyond that entirely by merit. But he hastened
to add: &ldquo;Indeed, if I may judge by the complaints that I have heard
out of doors, occasionally in the newspaper press, and elsewhere,
the system of promotion by merit is supposed to be carried to rather
an excessive extent in the Inland Revenue.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_273_280" id="FNanchor_273_280" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Glasgow Postmaster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mistake&rdquo;</em></div>

<p>In 1876, before the Select Committee on Post Office, Mr. Hobson,
Postmaster at Glasgow, stated that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
could not promote his telegraph operators according to their dexterity,
he was obliged to promote according to seniority. Mr. Gower, a member
of the Select Committee queried: &ldquo;Therefore, there is no encouragement
whatever to superior dexterity?&rdquo; Mr. Hobson replied: &ldquo;I should not
recommend a clerk for promotion &hellip; if I were satisfied that he
was not doing all he could to improve himself &hellip; and was only
an indifferent operator. I should mention that in submitting the
report, and recommend him to be passed over.&rdquo; Mr. Gower continued: &ldquo;But
suppose he took every sort of pains to improve himself, but did not
improve?&rdquo; The answer came: &ldquo;I would then recommend him to go forward
[<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span> for promotion].&rdquo; Mr. Gower then asked:
&ldquo;Have you any power to exchange a clerk who is a slow operator for
another quicker operator in a district where it would not signify?&rdquo; The
Postmaster at Glasgow replied: &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_274_281" id="FNanchor_274_281" class="fnanchor">274</a> The reader will
recall that there are numerous telegraph stations in Glasgow.</p>

<p>In April, 1877, the Postmaster General, Lord John Manners, replied
to the Report of the Select Committee of 1876, in a letter to the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. He concluded the letter with the
statement: &ldquo;In conclusion, I beg leave to say that it is, I think,
hardly worth while to attempt to contradict the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
mistakes as to promotion into which the postmaster of Glasgow
was accidentally betrayed in giving his evidence before the
Committee of last Session, and to which no reference is made in
their Report.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_275_282" id="FNanchor_275_282" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>Before the same Committee, Mr. Edward Graves, Divisional Engineer,
recommended that the head of the Post Office establish the rule, &ldquo;that,
other things being equal as to seniority and general business capacity,
preference for promotion shall always be given to the telegraph clerk
who has shown himself possessed of technical knowledge, and who is
desirous of obtaining technical information.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_276_283" id="FNanchor_276_283" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p>Passing over a period of 28 years, that is, from the year 1876
to the year 1904, we find Mr. E. Trenam, Controller London Central
Telegraph Office, testifying that because of danger that in the
immediate future there would be a lack of telegraph clerks who
had a knowledge of the technics of telegraphy, Mr. W. H. Preece,
Engineer-in-Chief, had caused a special increase in pay&mdash;$26 a
year&mdash;to be offered to men who should acquire such knowledge. The
witness added that &ldquo;unfortunately many of the men who have [acquired]
this knowledge are comparative juniors, and we are compelled to put
them to work which those receiving higher pay are incompetent to
perform. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
will take some years to adjust the anomaly &hellip; [that is, before
the incompetent men receiving higher pay shall have been pensioned or
shall have died]&rdquo;.<a href="#Footnote_277_284" id="FNanchor_277_284" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Promotion by Seniority, not Jobbery, the Public Service&rsquo;s weak Point</em></div>

<p>Before the Royal Commission of 1888, appointed to inquire into the
Civil Establishments, Sir Thomas H. Farrer, who had been a Member of
the Playfair Royal Commission of 1876, and had been Permanent Secretary
of the Board of Trade from 1867 to 1886, said: &ldquo;I should like to say
that in the discussion which led [in 1872] to the adoption of Mr.
Lowe&rsquo;s [Chancellor of the Exchequer] scheme<a href="#Footnote_278_285" id="FNanchor_278_285" class="fnanchor">278</a> [for the reform of
the civil service] a mistake was often made, and is still made, in
supposing that the great evil of the service is jobbery. That is not
the case, and I say so with great confidence, having regard to what
has been done by Ministers whom I have served of both parties. The
real evil of the service is promotion by routine, and not jobbing
in the selection for superior places.<a href="#Footnote_279_286" id="FNanchor_279_286" class="fnanchor">279</a> But make your
regulations what you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
will, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span>, to make any regulations work well, is that
the men at the head of the different offices shall have discretion,
honesty, and courage, and shall not be afraid to put up the good men
and to keep the inferior men in their place. I am quite confident from
my own experience that it can be done, but I am certain that it can be
done only if the men at the head of the offices will take a good deal
of trouble about it.&rdquo; Lord Lingen, a Member of the Royal Commission,
and a former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, interpolated: &ldquo;A good
deal of trouble and a good deal of disagreeable interference.&rdquo; Mr.
Farrer continued: &ldquo;It requires tact, because of course you must not
put a man up for mere merit. You cannot take a lad of 19 and put him
over a man of 30 without a very strong reason; but taking the different
sub-heads of the department into counsel; by a little give and take;
by care, discretion, and confidence in the perfect honesty with which
the thing is done, I believe it can be perfectly well managed&hellip;.
The key of the whole thing is to put the proper men at the top of the
offices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Lingen and Mr. Farrer then went on to state that with every
change of the Government of the day, some civil servants who had been
passed over, or had some other grievance, made the attempt to have
their cases reopened.<a href="#Footnote_280_287" id="FNanchor_280_287" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Charles DuCane, Chairman of the Commissioners of Customs,
said: &ldquo;We promote strictly by merit; we never allow seniority to
weigh with us.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_281_288" id="FNanchor_281_288" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>Sir Algernon E. West, Chairman of the Commissioners of Inland
Revenue, said that he promoted by merit within the limits allowed him
by the Treasury ruling that no clerk could pass out of the second class
into the first class without 10 years&rsquo; service in the second class.
Subsequent testimony established the fact that the Treasury had made
that ruling in order to prevent the second class clerks from bringing
pressure on Members of Parliament with the view to securing automatic
promotion from the second class into the first.<a href="#Footnote_282_289" id="FNanchor_282_289" class="fnanchor">282</a> Just before making
the foregoing statement, Sir Algernon West had said: &ldquo;If you take
the whole Civil Service, I think you will find a general concord of
opinion that the man receiving from $2,500 to $3,000 a year is the
weakest part of the Civil Service. I am not speaking of a young man
who is in process of going higher, but of an elderly man who has risen
to that kind of high salary, and has no prospect of getting anything
more&hellip;. An ordinary middle aged man, who has got to $2,500
or $3,000 or $3,500, generally is far too highly paid.&rdquo; Mr. R. W.
Hanbury, a Member of the Royal Commission, queried: &ldquo;How would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
he get such a position?&rdquo; The answer came: &ldquo;By natural progression,&rdquo;
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span> promotion by routine.<a href="#Footnote_283_290" id="FNanchor_283_290" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p>Sir Lyon Playfair, a man of vast experience in the administration of
the British Civil Service, said: &ldquo;Promotions by merit hardly take place
in most offices, I think; at all events, there are very few instances
brought before us.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_284_291" id="FNanchor_284_291" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Promotion by Seniority the Great Evil</em></div>

<p>The Royal Commission itself reported: &ldquo;We think that promotion
by seniority is the great evil of the Service, and that it is
indispensable to proceed throughout every branch of it strictly on the
principle of promotion by merit, that is to say, by selecting always
the fittest man, instead of considering claims in order of seniority,
and rejecting only the unfit. It is no doubt true that objections on
the score of favoritism may arise in the application of such a rule
in public departments, and the intervention of Members of Parliament
also presents an obvious difficulty, but we think that such constant
vigilance, tact, and resolution as may fairly be expected on the part
of heads of branches and of offices, will meet these objections, and we
believe that the certain advantages of promotion by merit to the most
deserving men, and therefore to the public service, are so great as to
be sure, in the long run, to command public support.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Able Men must &ldquo;wait their Turn&rdquo;</em></div>

<p>Shortly before the Royal Commission had made this recommendation,
in words which seemed to place the responsibility for past failure
to promote by merit, on the permanent officers of the Departments,
as distinguished from the political heads of the Departments, the
Ministers, Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster General, and the representative
in the House of Commons of the University of Cambridge, had refused to
accept the advice of the Permanent Secretary of the Post Office, Mr. S.
A. Blackwood, in filling a post of some importance in the Secretary&rsquo;s
office. On March 1, 1887, the Postmaster General, Mr. Raikes, in reply
to questions put to him in the House of Commons, said: &ldquo;&hellip;It is
also the fact that I have recently declined to adopt the Secretary&rsquo;s
recommendation to promote to the first class [in the Secretary&rsquo;s
office] one of the junior officers in the second class over the heads
of several clerks of much longer standing. The gentleman whom I have
promoted was, in my judgment, fully qualified for promotion, and was
senior clerk in the class, with the exception of one officer who,
on the Secretary&rsquo;s recommendation, has been passed over on sixteen
occasions&hellip;. What was I asked to do? I was asked to promote a
gentleman who was much lower down in the class, a gentleman who was
third or fourth in the class, and to place him over the heads of his
colleagues. This I declined to do. I made inquiries in the office, and
I found that the gentleman who was promoted was a meritorious officer
who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
had discharged his duties with adequate ability, and therefore I
thought there was no reason for promoting over his head and over
the heads of one or two other competent officers, a junior officer
who could well afford to wait his turn. I acted in the interests
of the Public Service, and especially in the interests of the
Department itself.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_285_292" id="FNanchor_285_292" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No Post Office official in the United Kingdom has power to make a
promotion. No one has power to do more than recommend for promotion.
Each recommendation for promotion is examined by the surveyor, and is
then sent to headquarters, where &ldquo;a most vigilant check is always
exercised, not from the suspicion that there has been favoritism,
but in order to secure that favoritism shall not be practised.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_286_293" id="FNanchor_286_293" class="fnanchor">286</a>
Ultimately
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the Postmaster General passes upon every recommendation. Sometimes
the action of the Postmaster General is merely formal, and is limited
to the mere affixing of the Postmaster General&rsquo;s signature to the
recommendation made by the permanent officers of the Department;
at other times it is independent, and is preceded by careful
consideration of the case by the Postmaster General himself. Whether
or not the Postmaster General shall give his personal attention to a
recommendation for promotion, is determined largely by the presence or
absence of the political element, that is, the temper of the House of
Commons. The Postmaster General is not a mere executive officer with
a single aim: the efficient administration of his Department. He is
first of all an important Minister, that is, one of the aids of the
Prime Minister in keeping intact the party following. He must know
to a nicety how any given administrative act in the Post Office will
affect his party&rsquo;s standing, first in Parliament, and then among the
constituents of the Members of Parliament. It is true that no British
Postmaster General would convert the Post Office into a political
engine for promoting the interests of his party; but it is equally
true that no British Postmaster General would for a moment lose sight
of the fact that Governments have not their being in either a vacuum
or a Utopia, but that they live in a medium constituted of Members of
Parliament and the constituents of Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a protest against the Postmaster General being a
Member of the House of Lords, Sir H. H. Fowler<a href="#Footnote_287_294" id="FNanchor_287_294" class="fnanchor">287</a> recently said: &ldquo;No
man who has sat in the House of Commons for 10 years can be ignorant of
the fact that there is a tone in the House; that there are occasions in
the House when, in dealing with votes [of Supply] and administrative
questions, a Minister is required, who, with his finger on the pulse
of the House, can sweep away the red tape limits and deal with the
questions at once on broad general public grounds.&rdquo; To make the
statement complete, Sir H. H. Fowler should have added the words: &ldquo;and
grounds of political expediency.&rdquo; In the course of his reply to Sir
H. H. Fowler, Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury
and representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster General,
said: &ldquo;When I undertook the representation of the Post Office in the
House of Commons, the first rule I laid down was that [in replying to
questions put by Members as to the administrative acts of the Post
Office] I would take no answer from a permanent official, and that all
answers [framed in the first instance by permanent officials] should
be seen and approved by the Postmaster General [a Member of the
House of Lords]. I also reserved to myself full discretion to alter
the answers if I saw any necessity so to do.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_288_295" id="FNanchor_288_295" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Anxieties of Postmasters General</em></div>

<p>In 1896, before the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. H. Joyce, Third
Secretary to General Post Office, London, said: &ldquo;I well remember
Mr. Fawcett&rsquo;s<a href="#Footnote_289_296" id="FNanchor_289_296" class="fnanchor">289</a> address to the head of a large Department
[of the Post Office] who, &hellip; having a large number of
promotions to recommend, had told the officers concerned whom he had
recommended, and whom he had not, and what made the matters worse,
he had in his recommendations taken little account of seniority,
whereas Mr. Fawcett, like Mr. Arnold Morley,<a href="#Footnote_290_297" id="FNanchor_290_297" class="fnanchor">290</a> had a perfect
horror of passing anyone over. I only saw Mr. Fawcett angry on
two occasions, and that was one of them.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_291_298" id="FNanchor_291_298" class="fnanchor">291</a> A moment before
giving this testimony, Mr. Joyce had said: &ldquo;It is always a matter of
deep regret to the Postmaster General&mdash;every Postmaster General
under whom I have served&mdash;when he is constrained to pass anyone
over. I have seen Mr. Arnold Morley in the greatest distress on
such occasions.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_292_299" id="FNanchor_292_299" class="fnanchor">292</a> Again, in defending the action of the Post
Office in promoting one Bocking, a second class sorting clerk at
Norwich, over the heads of 15 men in his own class, and 8 men in the
first class,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
to a full clerkship, Mr. Joyce said: &ldquo;It is a matter of the greatest
regret to the Postmaster General to feel constrained to pass over so
many officers, all of whom were thoroughly respectable and zealous, and
performed the duties on which they were employed very well, but the
lamentable fact remains that they were not fit for a higher position;
every endeavor was made at headquarters to what I might call squeeze
them through, but it was no use.&rdquo; Mr. Badcock, Controller London
Postal Service, corroborated this testimony with the words: &ldquo;The
statement is absolutely correct. The reports on which it was based
can be produced.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_293_300" id="FNanchor_293_300" class="fnanchor">293</a> In passing it may be added that in February,
1895, Mr. R. J. Price, M. P., for Norfolk, East, sought to intervene
from the floor of the House of Commons in this case of promotion. In
1892 and 1895, Mr. Price had been returned to Parliament from Norfolk,
East, with majorities of respectively 440 votes and 198 votes.</p>

<p>Still, again, at the Barry Dock Post Office, a branch office
in Cardiff, one Arnold had been promoted from position number 9,
by seniority, among the second class telegraph clerks, to a full
clerkship, skipping class 1 of the telegraphists. Of this action,
Mr. Joyce said: &ldquo;It was a matter of great regret to the Postmaster
General, as expressed at the time, to pass so many officers, many of
them most deserving men, but above Mr. Arnold there was actually no one
competent to fill
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
this important post. Some had a knowledge of postal work, and
some a knowledge of telegraph work, but none [beside Mr. Arnold]
were conversant with work of both kinds, and some were otherwise
objectionable. Barry Dock had suddenly shot into existence as a large
town, which has now a population of about 13,000, and so painful was it
to the Postmaster General to pass over all these deserving officers,
that, rather than do so, he seriously contemplated raising Barry Dock
to the level of a post town, and giving it a separate establishment
of its own.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_294_301" id="FNanchor_294_301" class="fnanchor">294</a> Again, one Robinson was transferred from the
Post Office at Pontefract to a clerkship in the office of Blackpool,
being made to pass over the heads of two young men at Blackpool, by
name of Eaton and Butcher. Mr. Joyce said: &ldquo;The case was specially
put before the Postmaster General, and with all his horror of
passing people over, he decided that the two young men Eaton and
Butcher were not qualified for promotion.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_295_302" id="FNanchor_295_302" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>&ldquo;A Strong Order&rdquo;</em></div>

<p>In 1885, one Robinson, a postman at Liverpool, and number 210 in
his class, was jumped to the position of assistant inspector. &ldquo;He had,
when a young postman, been selected by his inspector as a superior and
promising officer. He had been temporarily employed [by way of tests]
as assistant inspector, and had discharged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the duties so efficiently that, on a vacancy occurring, he had been
promoted to it.&rdquo; This case, as well as those previously mentioned, were
cited as &ldquo;grievances,&rdquo; before the Tweedmouth Committee, by the men
selected by the Post Office employees to act as their spokesmen before
the Committee. Lord Tweedmouth, chairman of the Committee, commenting
on the case, said to Mr. Joyce: &ldquo;Still, it seems to have been rather a
strong order to appoint an assistant postman to such an office and to
give him such a great promotion.&rdquo; Mr. Joyce replied: &ldquo;Yes, it certainly
does seem so; but for the position of inspector or assistant inspector
of postmen there is no doubt that qualifications are required which are
not ordinarily to be found in postmen&hellip;. For the positions of
inspectors and assistant inspectors, I think I may say that the local
authorities, and also headquarters, are more particular than they are
about any other promotion, and they are most anxious to select actually
the best man. In almost every other promotion, very great allowance
is made for seniority; but in the case of inspectors it is not so, on
account of the somewhat rare qualities required of inspectors, and
because the post is a most invidious one.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_296_303" id="FNanchor_296_303" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>The reader will note that in 1896 the Post Office employees were
complaining of a promotion made in 1885.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Ablest Man in the Sheffield Office</em></div>

<p>It was established before the Tweedmouth Committee that in
instances the Post Office employees, with the aid of Members of the
House of Commons, have succeeded in forcing the Post Office to revoke
promotions, or to promote men that have been passed over. For example,
Mr. Joyce, Third Secretary, General Post Office, said: &ldquo;Wykes is
unquestionably a very able man&mdash;probably the ablest man in the
Sheffield office&mdash;and it is quite true that he was promoted [from
a second class sortership] to be an assistant superintendent; but
for reasons quite unconnected with his ability and qualifications,
that promotion has been cancelled. Having said that, I trust the
Committee will not press me further upon the point, inasmuch as it
is very undesirable that I should say more.&rdquo; Mr. Spencer Walpole, a
Member of the Committee and the Secretary of the Post Office, added:
&ldquo;Except, perhaps, that the cancelling of that promotion had nothing
to do with the evidence that has been quoted?&rdquo; Mr. Joyce replied:
&ldquo;It had nothing to do with that; the matter is still in a certain
sense <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">subjudice</span>.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_297_304" id="FNanchor_297_304" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>An M. P. promotes Eleven Men</em></div>

<p>In 1887, one M&rsquo;Dougall, a second class sorter in Liverpool, was made
a first class sorter, being promoted over the heads of 14 men whom the
Liverpool postmaster had reported to be &ldquo;not qualified for the duties
of the higher class.&rdquo; On March 31, 1887, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Bradlaugh brought the matter up in the House of Commons, by means of a
question addressed to the Postmaster General. He was not satisfied with
the answer that the men passed over had been reported &ldquo;not qualified
for promotion.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_298_305" id="FNanchor_298_305" class="fnanchor">298</a> Therefore, on June 6, 1887, in Committee
of Supply, on the Post Office Vote, Mr. Bradlaugh again brought
up the case of the 14 Liverpool sorters who had been passed over.
He said he had personally investigated the qualifications of the
men, and had found &ldquo;that none of them warranted the answer given
by the Postmaster General&rdquo; [on March 31].<a href="#Footnote_299_306" id="FNanchor_299_306" class="fnanchor">299</a> Mr. Bradlaugh also
brought up the case of one Hegnett, who had been made assistant
superintendent over the heads of 19 persons &ldquo;who were his seniors
by many years.&rdquo; Also the case of one Helsby, promoted over the
heads of 11 persons. Also the case of one Miller, promoted over one
Richardson, &ldquo;who had been acting as assistant superintendent for years
with the salary of a Supervising Clerk only.&rdquo; Mr. Bradlaugh spoke of
the Committee of Supply as &ldquo;the only tribunal that can overrule the
Postmaster General.&rdquo; On June 17, Mr. Bradlaugh again intervened on
behalf of the 14 men who had been passed over.</p>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. F. T. Crosse, a sorting clerk
at Bristol, and one of the spokesmen of the Post Office employees,
said: &ldquo;Macdougall,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Liverpool, a second class sorting clerk, was promoted to the first
class over the heads of 14 men, his seniors. Mr. Bradlaugh, M. P.,
brought the matter up in Parliament during the discussion on the
Estimates. The result of Mr. Bradlaugh&rsquo;s intervention was that 11 of
the 14 men passed over were promoted in a batch six months later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Joyce, Third Secretary to General Post Office, London, said it
was true that &ldquo;very soon afterward,&rdquo; 11 of the 14 men were promoted.<a href="#Footnote_300_307" id="FNanchor_300_307" class="fnanchor">300</a>
&ldquo;A great point was stretched&rdquo; in favor of 5 of the 11 men. Those 5 men
were technically called single duty men, and since 1881 no sorting
clerk had been promoted to the first class [at Liverpool] who could not
perform dual duty. Although these five men were single duty men, and
therefore unable to rotate with others, which was a &ldquo;great disability,&rdquo;
they were promoted by reason of Mr. Bradlaugh&rsquo;s intervention.</p>

<p>In explanation of the Bradlaugh episode, it should be added, that
dual duty men are those who are able to act as letter sorters as
well as telegraphists; while single duty men are able to act only as
sorters, or as telegraphists. In order to reap full advantage from the
consolidation of the telegraph business with the Postal business, the
Post Office for years has been seeking to induce as many as possible
of its employees to make themselves competent to act both as sorters and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as telegraphists. At offices where it would be particularly
advantageous to have the men able to act both as sorters and as
telegraphists, the Post Office has sought to establish the rule that
no sorter or telegraphist shall be promoted to the first class, unless
able to act both as sorter and as telegraphist.</p>

<p>Mr. Crosse was not the only witness before the Tweedmouth Committee
whose testimony illustrated &ldquo;the stimulus&rdquo; conveyed by questions in
the House of Commons. Mr. C. J. Ansell, the representative of the
second class tracers in London, stated that in 1891 two vacancies
among the first class tracers in a London office had been left open
for respectively 5 months and 8 months. He added: &ldquo;In March, 1894, the
Postmaster General&rsquo;s attention had to be called to this disgraceful
state of affairs [by the tracers&rsquo; union]. It required, however, the
stimulus of a question in the House of Commons. We do not know how
far the Postmaster General is responsible for this state of affairs,
but it is only fair to state that his attention being drawn to this
matter by the question, we were successful in getting those promotions
ante-dated.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_301_308" id="FNanchor_301_308" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The limitations upon the Postmaster General&rsquo;s power to promote men
in accordance with the advice tendered him by his official advisers by
no means is confined to the cases of promotion among the rank and file.
For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
instance, it was established by the testimony given before the
Tweedmouth Committee, that the Postmaster cannot freely promote, to
offices of more importance, postmasters who show that they have more
ability than is required to administer the offices over which they
happen to preside. For if a postmaster proves to be not equal to the
demands of his office, the Postmaster General cannot always remove
him to a smaller office, promoting at the same time the more able man
who happens to be in charge of the smaller office. The Department
tries to meet the situation by sending to the aid of the relatively
incompetent postmaster &ldquo;a smart chief clerk,&rdquo; taking care, however,
that the inefficient postmaster shall receive less than the full salary
to which the volume of business of the office would entitle him. If
that expedient fails, the Department will transfer the postmaster.
Mr. Uren, postmaster at Maidstone, and President of the Postmasters&rsquo;
Association, even asserted that nothing short of misconduct would
lead to the transfer of a postmaster.<a href="#Footnote_302_309" id="FNanchor_302_309" class="fnanchor">302</a> It should be added,
however, that Mr. Uren&rsquo;s testimony related to the small and medium
sized places only, not to the larger cities.<a href="#Footnote_303_310" id="FNanchor_303_310" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>It must not be inferred, however, that the postmasters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of the small and medium sized places appeared before the Tweedmouth
Committee to demand unrestricted promotion by merit. On the contrary,
with the great bulk of the public service of all descriptions,<a href="#Footnote_304_311" id="FNanchor_304_311" class="fnanchor">304</a>
they held that promotion is &ldquo;slow and uncertain&rdquo; and that the system
of promotion by merit &ldquo;is thoroughly uncertain in its practical
working.&rdquo; They protested also against the uncertainty and inequality
inseparable from the system of making postmasters&rsquo; salaries dependent
upon the volume of business done by the several and individual Post
Offices. They held that no postmaster should be made to suffer by
reason of the fact that he happened to be stationed in a town or
city that was not growing, or was not growing so rapidly as were
other cities. By way of relief from the foregoing &ldquo;uncertainties&rdquo; and
&ldquo;inequalities&rdquo; they demanded a reorganization of the postal service
which should secure to the postmasters regular annual increments
of pay, and should &ldquo;regularize&rdquo; promotion.<a href="#Footnote_305_312" id="FNanchor_305_312" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Rank and File Oppose Promotion by Merit</em></div>

<p>It will be remembered that the Royal Commission appointed to inquire
into the Civil Establishments, 1888, expressed the belief: &ldquo;that the
certain advantages of promotion by merit to the most deserving men,
and therefore to the public service, are so great as to be sure, in
the long run, to command public support.&rdquo; But the fact remains that a
large part of the rank and file of the British civil service is growing
more and more intolerant of promotion by merit, and demands promotion
by seniority. It will not accept as a fact the natural inequality of
men; it asserts, with its cousins at the Antipodes, the Australasian
civil servants, that it is the opportunity that makes the man, not the
man that makes the opportunity. This impatience of the rank and file of
the civil servants of promotion by merit was brought out in striking
manner by many of the &ldquo;grievances&rdquo; cited by the men who appeared before
the Tweedmouth Committee as the accredited representatives of the Post
Office employees. Some of those allegations of grievance have just been
recorded, but this matter is of sufficient importance to warrant the
recording of still others.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Shephard, Chairman of the Metropolitan Districts Board
of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, complained before the
Tweedmouth Committee that one West, who had entered the telegraph
service as a learner in 1881, one month after one Ward had entered as a
learner, in 1896 was receiving $640,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
whereas Ward was receiving only $550. It was true that Ward had &ldquo;had
the misfortune to fail in the needle examination,&rdquo; the first time he
had tried to qualify as a telegraphist, but &ldquo;that little failure&rdquo;
ought not to have made the difference which existed in 1896. Mr.
Shephard also complained that one Morgan, after 14 years and 11
months of service, was receiving only $550, whereas one Kensington,
after 14 years and 5 months of service, was receiving $670. He
brushed aside as of no consequence, the fact that Kensington had
&ldquo;qualified&rdquo; in four months, whereas Ward had taken twelve months
to &ldquo;qualify.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_306_313" id="FNanchor_306_313" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>One Richardson, a telegraphist, at his own request had been
transferred from Horsham to East Grinstead, and thence to Redhill,
because of the small chances of vacancies at the first two places. But
the staff at Redhill was weak and therefore the Post Office could not
follow its usual practice of promoting a man, &ldquo;not because he is a
good man, but because he is not a bad one,&rdquo; to use the words of Mr. J.
C. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service.<a href="#Footnote_307_314" id="FNanchor_307_314" class="fnanchor">307</a> The authorities had
to promote the best man at Redhill, and thus Richardson was passed
over. Mr. James Green, who appeared as the representative of the Postal
Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, referred to Richardson&rsquo;s case as &ldquo;the
case
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of a learner who with some 5 years&rsquo; service is, according to my
information, sent here and there relieving, presumably as a sort of
recompense, though what his future will be remains a mystery. What
surprises me in this matter is the spirit of indifference displayed
by the heads of our Department regarding the hopelessness of these
learners&rsquo; positions.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_308_315" id="FNanchor_308_315" class="fnanchor">308</a> One J. R. Walker was an indoor messenger
until October, 1893, when he was apprenticed a paid learner. Shortly
before October, two lads had been brought in as paid learners;
and, after a short service, they were appointed sorting clerks and
telegraphists. They were promoted over Walker, because of their
superior education and intelligence. Mr. Green, the representative
of the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, admitted the superior
education of the lads in question, but complained that they had been
preferred to Walker.<a href="#Footnote_309_316" id="FNanchor_309_316" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Crompton Episode</em></div>

<p>One Crompton, a letter sorting clerk at Liverpool, in his leisure
moments had made himself a telegraph instrument, had taught himself
to telegraph, and had acquired a considerable technical knowledge of
electricity. He had attracted the attention of the superintending
engineer at Liverpool; had been promoted, in 1886, to the office of
the superintending engineer; and, by 1896, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
become one of the best engineers in the service. In 1896, Mr. Tipping,
the accredited spokesman of the Postal Telegraphists&rsquo; Association
as well as of the Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, complained of the
promotion of Crompton, which had occurred in 1886. He said: &ldquo;It seems
most unreasonable that men who have, in some cases, not the slightest
acquaintance with telegraphic apparatus and methods of working,
should be preferred to those whose whole period of service has been
passed in immediate connection therewith. It is apparent that such an
absence of method is open to very serious objections, and allows great
freedom of choice to those upon whose recommendations the appointments
are made. In order, therefore, to safeguard, on the one hand, the
interests of the department, and, on the other, to encourage those
members of the telegraph staff who desire, by energy and ability,
to improve their official <em>status</em>, the following suggestions are
humbly submitted: That vacancies for junior clerkships in the offices
of the superintending engineers, and for clerks at relay stations,
should be filled by open competitive examination, held under the
control of the Civil Service Commissioners, and that telegraphists
only be eligible.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_310_317" id="FNanchor_310_317" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>The Crompton episode shows what minute supervision over the
administration of the Post Office the civil service unions seek to
exercise. The same minute
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
supervision was attempted as recently as 1903-04 by Mr. Nannetti,
M. P. for the College Division of Dublin, and also a Member of
the Corporation of Dublin, as well as a member of the Dublin Port
and Docks Board.<a href="#Footnote_311_318" id="FNanchor_311_318" class="fnanchor">311</a> On March 23, 1903, Mr. Nannetti spoke as
follows, in the House of Commons: &ldquo;I beg to ask the Postmaster
General whether his attention has been directed to the fact that two
female technical officers, appointed in connection with the recently
introduced intercommunication switch system in London, were selected
over the heads of seniors possessing equal qualifications, and whether,
seeing that in one case the official selected was taught switching
duties by a telegraphist who is now passed over, he will state the
reason for the selection of these officers?&rdquo; The Postmaster General,
Mr. Austen Chamberlain, replied: &ldquo;The honorable Member has been
misinformed. There is no question of promoting or passing over any
officer. All that has been done is to assign to particular duties,
carrying no special rank or pay, two officers who were believed to be
competent to perform them.&rdquo; On May 7, 1903, Mr. Nannetti followed up
the question with another one, namely: &ldquo;I beg to ask the Postmaster
General whether his attention has been called to the fact that two
women telegraphists were selected to perform technical duties in
reference to the intercommunication switch in London, who were juniors
in service and possessed of less technical qualifications
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
than other women telegraphists who were passed over; and whether,
seeing that, although official information was given that such
selection was not a question of promotion and no special rank or pay
would result, one of the two officers concerned has been appointed
to a superior grade on account of her experience gained by being
selected for these duties, he will explain why the more senior and
experienced women were passed over in the first place?&rdquo; The Postmaster
General replied: &ldquo;I have nothing to add to the answer I gave on March
23, beyond stating that the officer to whom he is supposed to refer
has not been appointed to any superior grade. She has merely been
lent temporarily to assist at the Central Telephone Exchange in work
for which she has special qualifications.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_312_319" id="FNanchor_312_319" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>On April 19 and May 12, 1904, Mr. Nannetti again protested against
the promotion of the woman in question to the position of first class
assistant supervisor, saying: &ldquo;This girl was appointed because she had
strong friends at Court&hellip;.&rdquo; On the latter date Mr. Nannetti also
intervened on behalf of a telegraphist at North Wall, whose salary had
been reduced from $6 a week to $5, as well as on behalf of one Wood,
who had been retired on a reduced pension, by way of punishment. The
case of Wood, Mr. Nannetti had brought up in 1903, when the Post Office
Vote was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
under discussion. For the purpose of bringing these several
matters before the House, he now moved the reduction of the
salary of the Postmaster General by $500.<a href="#Footnote_313_320" id="FNanchor_313_320" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>On March 16, 1903, Mr. Nannetti asked whether the statement of
the Controller that there was not a man qualified for promotion

the Department in the filling of a certain vacancy in the Dublin
Post Office.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_314_321" id="FNanchor_314_321" class="fnanchor">314</a> That question illustrated a type of
intervention that suggests the possibility of Great Britain reaching
the stage that has been reached in Australia, where Members of
Parliament have been known to move reductions in the salaries of
officers who had offended the rank and file by attempting to introduce
businesslike methods and practices. If that stage ever is reached,
there will be a great multiplication of cases like the following one.
Before the Tweedmouth Committee appeared Mr. J. Shephard, Chairman
Metropolitan Districts Board of Postal Clerks&rsquo; Association, to champion
the cause of Mr.&mdash;&mdash;. Said Mr. Shephard: &ldquo;I have it here
on his word that his postmaster has recommended him for a vacant
clerkship at the District Office. Mr.&mdash;&mdash; has served for
many years under the eyes of this postmaster who recommends him for
promotion, and I take it that that is full and sufficient evidence of
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s fitness
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
to perform the duties of the clerk.&rdquo; Mr. J. C. Badcock, Controller
London Postal Service, testified in reply that he had summoned the
postmaster in question, who had admitted that Mr.&mdash;&mdash;
had discharged &ldquo;minor clerical duties&rdquo; in a perfectly satisfactory
manner, but that his recommendation that Mr.&mdash;&mdash; should
be promoted to a clerkship, &ldquo;was made more out of sympathy with
the man than with any hope that he would be qualified to undertake
the higher duties which he would have to succeed to if appointed
to a clerkship.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_315_322" id="FNanchor_315_322" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>In March, 1903, Mr. M. Joyce, M. P. for Limerick as well as an
Alderman, asked the Postmaster General:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether it is his intention to promote a local official to
the assistant superintendentship now vacant at the Limerick Post
Office, and, if not, will he assign the reason&hellip;? May I ask
whether the duties of this office have not been performed in the
most satisfactory manner by a local officer during the absence of
the assistant superintendent, and will he give this matter due
consideration, as every class of the community would be pleased at
such an appointment.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_318_325" id="FNanchor_318_325" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>In April, 1903, Mr. Shehan asked the Postmaster General: &ldquo;Whether
his attention has been directed to an application from Dennis
Murphy, at present acting as auxiliary postman, for appointment to
the vacant position of rural postman from Mill Street to Culler,
County Cork; and whether, in view of the man&rsquo;s character and
qualifications, he will consider the advisability of appointing him
to the vacancy?&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_319_326" id="FNanchor_319_326" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>In February, 1903, Mr. Nannetti asked the Postmaster General
&ldquo;whether he is aware that a telegraphist named Mercer, of the Bristol
Post Office, has applied for 160 vacant postmaster ships since 1894;
whether, seeing that during these periods clerks of less service,
experience, ability and salary have been the recipients of these

asked the Secretary to the Treasury, as representing the Postmaster
General, &ldquo;whether he is aware that a postman named Jackson, in
Kilkenny, has been in the Post Office service over 20 years and that
his wages at present are only 12s. per week; and whether Jackson
was given the increment of 1s. 6d. per week fixed by the new wages
scale which came into operation in April, 1897; and if not, whether
he will cause inquiry to be made into the case, with the view of
giving Jackson the wages to which he is entitled by the rules of the
service?&rdquo; Mr. R. W. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
replied: &ldquo;The rural postman at Kilkenny to whom the Honorable Member
refers was transferred, on June 19, to another walk at that place,
carrying wages of 16s. a week. His previous duty was not sufficient
to warrant higher wages than 12s. a week.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_322_329" id="FNanchor_322_329" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>In April, 1901, Sir George Newnes, M. P. for Swansea, protested
against the promotion out of order,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>

at Swansea.<a href="#Footnote_323_330" id="FNanchor_323_330" class="fnanchor">323</a> Sir George Newnes is the founder of

<p>In February and March, 1903, Mr. C. E. Schwann, M. P. for
Manchester, protested against the promotion out of order of two
men at Manchester, who had been respectively numbers 99 and 133

President of the Manchester Liberal Association. In 1900 he was elected
to Parliament by a majority of twenty-six votes.</p>

<p>In July, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the Financial Secretary to
the Treasury: &ldquo;Whether the overseer&rsquo;s vacancy in the South Eastern
Metropolitan district, created by the death of Mr. Feldwick, and
recently filled by a suburban officer, will now be restored to the
town establishment, seeing that the appointment properly belongs to
this establishment?&rdquo; Mr. Austen Chamberlain replied: &ldquo;The vacancy in
question has been filled by the transfer of an overseer from a suburban
office in the same postal district, but the vacancy thus created in
the suburbs has been filled by the promotion of an officer in the town
district office.&rdquo; In August, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the Financial
Secretary to the Treasury: &ldquo;Whether he is aware that the overseer&rsquo;s
vacancy which occurred in the town establishment of the South Eastern
Metropolitan District by the promotion of Mr. May to an inspectorship
at another office, has been filled by the transfer of an officer in the
suburban establishment, thus diverting a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
town vacancy to the suburbs; and whether, in view of the fact that
the chances of promotion in the suburban establishments are 75 per
cent. better than in the town establishment, he will cause the
vacancy to be restored to the establishment in which it originally
occurred?&rdquo; Mr. Austen Chamberlain replied: &ldquo;The Postmaster General
is aware of the effect of the promotion in question, and has
already arranged that the balance of promotion shall be readjusted
on an early opportunity by the transfer of a town [officer] to a
suburban vacancy.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_325_332" id="FNanchor_325_332" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>On March 24, 1905, Mr. Charles Hobhouse, M. P. for Bristol, asked
the Postmaster General &ldquo;why a number of men with unblemished character
and with service ranging from 15 to 25 years have, in the recent
promotions in the Bristol Post Office, been passed over in favor of
a junior postman?&rdquo; In 1906, Mr. Hobhouse was made a member of the

<p>On the same day, Mr. Sloan asked the Postmaster

capable men, are compelled to rotate on irregular duties with irregular

<p>On August 2, 1906, the Postmaster General, Mr. Sydney Buxton,
replied to Mr. Sloan: &ldquo;I cannot review cases of promotion decided by my

those several kinds of intervention. But these quotations may not be
brought to an end without mention of the qualifying fact that Lord

      good character. Thus, on a vacancy occurring in a higher
      class, not being the first class of clerks, recommend for
      promotion that officer of highest standing [according to
      seniority] in the class next below who is qualified for the
      efficient performance of the duties of the higher class,
      and has conducted himself with diligence, propriety and

      officer other than the one of highest standing [according to
      seniority] in his class, furnish a tabular statement after the

   CHAPTER XVI <br /><span class="smcap">Members of the House of
   Commons Intervene on Behalf of Public Servants Who Have Been
   Disciplined</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Evidence presented before: The Royal Commission appointed
   to inquire into the Civil Establishments, 1888; and the
   Tweedmouth Committee, 1897. Instances of intervention by
   Members of Parliament. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial
   Secretary to the Treasury, in April, 1902, states that at a
   low estimate one-third of the time of the highest officials in
   the Post Office is occupied with petty questions of discipline
   and administrative detail, because of the intervention
   of Members of Parliament. He adds that it is &ldquo;absolutely
   deplorable&rdquo; that time and energy that should be given to the
   consideration of large questions must be given to matters that
   &ldquo;in any private business would be dealt with by the officer
   on the spot.&rdquo; Sir John Eldon Gorst&rsquo;s testimony before the
   Committee on National Expenditure, 1902.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>M. P.&rsquo;s and the Rank and File</em></div>

<p>In 1888, Mr. Harvey, a Member of the Royal Commission appointed
to inquire into the Civil Establishments, asked Sir S. A. Blackwood,
Secretary to the Post Office since 1880: &ldquo;Now I should like to ask you
&hellip; whether you consider there is a distinct tendency among the
clerical establishments [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, the clerks above the rank and file],
especially the lower division clerks, to develop what for want of a
better term I will call trades union spirit?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I believe there is
a good deal of evidence of that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you, yourself,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
found it difficult to deal with that; is it a factor in your
administration [of the Post Office]?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not with regard to the lower
division clerks [above the rank and file]; it is with regard to the
subordinate ranks of the service, the rank and file; amongst them there
is a very strong tendency in that direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;A growing tendency?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is certainly growing.&rdquo; &ldquo;A growing tendency then we may say to
introduce the co&ouml;peration of Members of Parliament to deal with
individual grievances?&rdquo; &ldquo;A very strongly growing tendency.&rdquo; At this
point Mr. Lawson interrupted: &ldquo;Individual or class grievances?&rdquo; &ldquo;Class
grievances, but there are a great many instances in which individual
grievances are brought forward [by Members of Parliament].&rdquo; &ldquo;The
point of the question was whether this spirit of trades unionism was
evoked for the sake of bringing forward individual grievances, and
you said yes; and then I asked whether it was class grievances or
individual grievances?&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean class grievances, but it is made use
of in respect of individual grievances.&rdquo; Mr. Harvey resumed: &ldquo;And you
think it is growing?&rdquo; &ldquo;I think it is strongly growing.&rdquo; &ldquo;So we may
say, to repeat the question I put just now, that it makes a factor
in your administration of the Post Office, and you have always to be
prepared to meet this growing tendency?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is continuously raising
difficulties, and very serious ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson queried: &ldquo;You said something about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
trades unionism; do you think it is possible by any regulation to
stop trades unionism of a great class such as the senior division, or
the classes which are the subordinate part of your establishment?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think it would be very difficult.&rdquo; &ldquo;You would have to reckon
with that as a permanent factor?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_329_336" id="FNanchor_329_336" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>This intervention on behalf of individual employees is managed as
follows. Members of Parliament first interview the Postmaster General;
if they fail to obtain satisfaction, they bring the grievance of
their constituent before the House of Commons, by means of a question
addressed in the House to the Postmaster General. It will be remembered
that Mr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in 1900 stated
that he had agreed to represent the Postmaster General in the House
of Commons only on condition that he should be given full freedom to
answer such questions in any way he saw fit, and that he should not be
bound by any answers furnished him either by the permanent officers
of the Post Office or by the Postmaster General. And that Sir H. H.
Fowler protested against the Postmaster General sitting in the House of
Lords, on the ground that the questions asked by Members of the House
of Commons often demanded to be answered by a man who had his finger
on the pulse of the House, and was able to cut through the red tape of
officialism on public grounds, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
meant, to set aside the rules of the Department in response to the
exigencies of political expediency.</p>

<p>If the answer given by the Postmaster General is unsatisfactory,
the Member of Parliament gives notice that he will bring the matter
up again on the discussion of the Estimates of Expenditure. In the
meantime he brings to bear, behind the scenes, what pressure he can
command. And he often learns to appreciate the grim humor of the reply
once given by a former Minister of Railways in Victoria, Australia,
to a Victorian Royal Commission, to the query whether political
influence was exercised in the administration of the State railways of
Victoria. The reply had been: &ldquo;I should like to know how you can have a
politician without political influence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course not all cases of intervention by Members of Parliament are
as successful as was the intervention of Mr. Bradlaugh, which resulted
in the promotion of eleven men out of fourteen who had been passed over
as &ldquo;not qualified for promotion,&rdquo; or, as was the intervention of the
Member of Parliament whose name was not revealed, which brought about
the revocation of the promotion of the ablest man in the Post Office
at Sheffield. Indeed, the principal effect of these interventions is
not to force the Post Office to retrace steps already taken, it is to
prevent the Post Office from taking certain steps. These interventions
modify the entire administration of the British Post Office. They
compel the Postmaster General and his leading officers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to consider the political aspect of every proposal coming from the
local postmasters, and other intermediate officers, be it a proposal
to promote, to pass over, to discipline, or to dismiss. It was this
possibility of intervention by Members of Parliament, acting under
pressure from civil servants&rsquo; unions, that gave the late Mr. Fawcett
&ldquo;a perfect horror of passing over,&rdquo; that caused Mr. Arnold Morley &ldquo;the
greatest distress&rdquo; whenever he had to pass anyone over, and that led
Mr. Raikes to state in the House of Commons, that, &ldquo;in the interests
of the Public Service, and especially in the interests of the Post
Office itself,&rdquo; he had declined to follow the advice of his officers
that he promote a certain clerk in the Secretary&rsquo;s Office; as well
as that he made it his practice to try to mitigate the rules of the
Department governing punishment and dismissal. It was with the thought
of Parliamentary intervention in mind, that Mr. Austen Chamberlain,<a href="#Footnote_330_337" id="FNanchor_330_337" class="fnanchor">330</a>
Postmaster General, said, in February, 1903: &ldquo;The selection of officers
for promotion is always an invidious task.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><em>Typical Grievances</em></div>

<p>The testimony given before the Tweedmouth Committee, 1897, contains
a number of incidents which show how leniently the Post Office
Department is obliged to deal with men who violate the rules. These
incidents were brought before the Committee by the representatives of
the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
employees of the Post Office, for the purpose of proving by individual
cases, that the Department&rsquo;s rulings were unduly severe, and afforded
just cause for grievance.</p>

<p>One Webster, a letter carrier at Liverpool, in July, 1883, failed
to cover his whole walk, and brought back to the office, letters which
he should have delivered. These letters he surreptitiously inserted
among the letters of other carriers. Mr. Herbert Joyce, Third Secretary
to General Post Office, said dismissal would not have been harsh
punishment for the offence; but Webster was merely deprived of one
good conduct stripe, worth 25 cents a week. In 1884 and 1885 Webster&rsquo;s
increment of salary was arrested for unsatisfactory conduct. In July,
1886, Webster was removed from his walk, and reduced to the &ldquo;junior
men&rdquo; on the &ldquo;relief force,&rdquo; for having been under the influence of
drink while on duty. In 1890, Webster complained to headquarters of
harsh treatment, stating that though he had served 15 years, he had not
received three good conduct stripes. And in 1896, Mr. J. S. Smith, the
official representative of the provincial postmen, deemed it expedient
to cite the case to the Tweedmouth Committee in the course of an
argument to the effect that there was too great a difference &ldquo;between
the punishment meted out to postmen and the punishment meted out to
sorters; not that I say the punishment is too slight for sorters, but
it is, I might say, too severe for postmen,&rdquo; It may be added that, in
1896, Webster
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
was recommended for three good conduct stripes, though the regulation
says that a good conduct stripe shall be awarded only for five
clear and consecutive years of good conduct. Non-observance of that
regulation led the Tweedmouth Committee to report: &ldquo;The practice which
has grown up in the Department of awarding two stripes at the same
time to a man whose service exceeds 10 years, but whose unblemished
service extends over only 5 years, is, we think, a bad one, and should
be discontinued.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_331_338" id="FNanchor_331_338" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p>The foregoing recommendation of the Tweedmouth Committee was not
endorsed by the Government. On March 13, 1906, the Postmaster General,
Mr. Sydney Buxton, in reply to Mr. Thomas Smyth, M. P., who was
intervening on behalf of one Thomas Reilly, said: &ldquo;I find that Thomas
Reilly would have been entitled to an increase of one shilling and
six pence a week in his wages as from April 1, 1905, if his conduct
during the preceding twelve months had been satisfactory. Unfortunately
the necessary certificate to that effect could not be given, but the
question of granting the increase to Reilly will come up again for
consideration shortly&hellip;. It will be necessary to postpone
for a time the award of a second stripe.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_332_339" id="FNanchor_332_339" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>In October, 1895, one Roberts, an auxiliary postman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
was warned that he would be dismissed unless his conduct improved.
He had been reported for &ldquo;treating parcel receptacles in a rough and
reckless manner, and smashing the parcels.&rdquo; In November, 1895, he
altered the address on a parcel in order to save himself the trouble
of delivering the parcel on the day on which he made the alteration.
The parcel was given to a carrier on another route, who returned it
as not deliverable. After some delay the parcel finally was delivered
by Roberts. When Mr. S. Walpole, Secretary of the Post Office, heard
this testimony, he exclaimed: &ldquo;And was Roberts dismissed on the spot?&rdquo;
Mr. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, replied: &ldquo;No. The
overseer described him as totally unreliable, and he was warned for
the last time.&rdquo; Mr. Walpole continued: &ldquo;Why was he not dismissed?&rdquo;
Mr. Badcock replied: &ldquo;Well, he ought to have been.&rdquo; In January, 1896,
Roberts was again cautioned; on February 24, 1896, he failed to attend
his morning duty; and he was seriously cautioned again. In March,
1896, he was guilty of &ldquo;gross carelessness,&rdquo; and was told to look
for other employment. Thereupon Roberts wrote his postmaster that
he was a member of the Postmen&rsquo;s Federation. Shortly afterward, Mr.
Churchfield, Secretary of the Postmen&rsquo;s Federation, brought Roberts&rsquo;
case before the Tweedmouth Committee, alleging that the Post Office
Department had dismissed Roberts because he had supplied evidence to
the representatives of the postal employees who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
had appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee.<a href="#Footnote_333_340" id="FNanchor_333_340" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>In 1878, one Woodhouse, a postman at Norwich, was suspended for
two days for irregular attendance, having been late 42 times in three
months. In 1880, he was suspended for three days, having been late 173
times during the year. Woodhouse also had been very troublesome to the
inspector, setting a bad example to the younger men. In 1882, he was
absent from duty because of intoxication, was grossly insubordinate
to the local postmaster, whom he set at defiance, and also grossly
insubordinate to the surveyor. The local postmaster recommended that
he be dismissed. &ldquo;At headquarters, however, with a large, and some
people think a very undue, leniency, it was decided to give him one
more trial.&rdquo; In 1889, Woodhouse was cautioned by the postmaster
for insubordinate conduct to the inspector. In 1891 and 1892, the
postmaster refused to recommend him for good conduct stripes. In 1894
there was a marked improvement in Woodhouse&rsquo;s conduct. The improvement
was maintained, and in 1896, Woodhouse was recommended for good conduct
stripes. Of this man, Mr. J. S. Smith, the official representative
of the provincial postmen, said, in 1896, before the Tweedmouth
Committee: &ldquo;The last 17 or 18 years of Woodhouse&rsquo;s career have been of
a most exemplary description, a good time-keeper and zealous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
in the discharge of his duties, and yet, though he had been a postman
for 25 years, he has never been the recipient of a good conduct stripe.
By this means he has been deprived of about $450, truly a great loss
for a postman to suffer through having this vast sum deducted from
his wages. It needs no words of mine to point out the great injustice
that has been inflicted upon Woodhouse. Any little irregularity that
may have occurred (such as bad time-keeping, which is admitted) in the
first 7 or 8 years of his service, has been amply atoned for by 17 or
18 years&rsquo; punctuality and excellent behavior.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_334_341" id="FNanchor_334_341" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>In November, 1895, a letter carrier at Manchester came &ldquo;under
the influence of drink,&rdquo; and reached at 3.50 p. m. a point in his
walk which he should have reached at 2.30 p. m. &ldquo;On the following
day he was again under the influence of drink and unfit to make
his delivery.&rdquo; The punishment was the deprivation of one good
conduct stripe.<a href="#Footnote_335_342" id="FNanchor_335_342" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>In December, 1895, a postman at Newcastle, while off duty, but in
uniform, &ldquo;was reeling along [one of the principal streets] intoxicated
at 3 p. m.&rdquo; The case was sent up to the Postmaster General, who
decided that the man should lose one good conduct stripe. Mr. Spencer
Walpole, a member of the Tweedmouth Committee,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
and the Permanent Secretary to the Post Office, said dismissal
would not have been too severe a punishment; and Mr. H. Joyce,
Third Secretary General Post Office, London, assented to the
statement.<a href="#Footnote_336_343" id="FNanchor_336_343" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p>Mr. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, in replying to
the testimony of Mr. A. F. Harris, the official representative of
the London postmen, said that it was true that while one Worth for
some years past had off and on been made an acting head postman,
he had not been recommended for promotion to the position of head
postman, because his postmaster had reported that he was &ldquo;shifty,
unreliable, and careless.&rdquo; Mr. Walpole, Secretary of the Post Office,
thereupon queried: &ldquo;Is that not a reason for not employing him to
act as head postman?&rdquo; Mr. Badcock replied: &ldquo;It was thought better
to give him a chance, instead of letting him have the grievance of
complaining that he had not had an opportunity of showing whether
he was qualified.&rdquo; Mr. Walpole continued: &ldquo;But if he showed himself
shifty, unreliable, and careless for several years, ought not his
trial as a head postman to cease?&rdquo; Mr. Badcock replied: &ldquo;I must confess
that I think so.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_337_344" id="FNanchor_337_344" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In February, 1887, Mr. Marum intervened in the House
of Commons on behalf of one Ward, a telegraphist, who had
been dismissed in 1876 because he had discharged his duties
unsatisfactorily.<a href="#Footnote_338_345" id="FNanchor_338_345" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>In February, 1888, Mr. Lawson, a Member of the Royal Commission
appointed to inquire into the Civil Establishments, intervened
on behalf of one Harvey, a letter carrier who had been dismissed
in 1882.<a href="#Footnote_339_346" id="FNanchor_339_346" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>In March, 1901, Mr. Bartley<a href="#Footnote_340_347" id="FNanchor_340_347" class="fnanchor">340</a> intervened on
behalf of one Canless, who had been dismissed because the Postmaster
General &ldquo;was of the opinion that Mr. Canless was not a fit person
to be retained in the service.&rdquo; On dismissing the man, the Post
Office had deducted from his pay the value of a postal money
order&mdash;$2.25&mdash;alleged to have been stolen by him.<a href="#Footnote_341_348" id="FNanchor_341_348" class="fnanchor">341</a>
Canless&rsquo; case was brought up again in August, 1904, upon the occasion
of the debate upon the Report of the Bradford Committee.</p>

<p>In July, 1897, Mr. C. Seale-Hayne intervened on behalf of one J. C.
Kinsman, dismissed for insubordination and delegation of his duties to
unauthorized persons.<a href="#Footnote_342_349" id="FNanchor_342_349" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>In August, 1903, Mr. Sloan, M. P. for Belfast, intervened
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
on behalf of one Templeton, of the Belfast Post Office, dismissed
for emptying ink on the head of a workman engaged in the Post
Office.<a href="#Footnote_343_350" id="FNanchor_343_350" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>In March, 1905, Mr. John Campbell, M. P., tried to induce the
Postmaster General to reopen the case of one M&rsquo;Cusker, who had been
disciplined in 1897.<a href="#Footnote_344_351" id="FNanchor_344_351" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>In April, 1899, Mr. Lenty asked for a pension for one Wright, whose
&ldquo;conduct had been such as to render him unfit for further employment in
the public service.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_345_352" id="FNanchor_345_352" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p>In August, 1902, Mr. Crean asked for a pension for W. H.
Allshire, &ldquo;Who was reported for certain irregularities for
which he would probably have been dismissed. While the matter
was under consideration he sent in his resignation, which was
accepted.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_346_353" id="FNanchor_346_353" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>In August, 1903, Mr. L. Sinclair intervened on behalf of B. J.
Foreman, &ldquo;who was not qualified for the award of a pension, as he was
neither 60 years of age nor incapacitated from the performance of
his duty&rdquo; when his service was terminated.<a href="#Footnote_347_354" id="FNanchor_347_354" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>In March, 1891, Earl Compton intervened on behalf of a first class
sorter who had been reduced to the second class after having been
sentenced to a fine by a Police Magistrate.<a href="#Footnote_348_355" id="FNanchor_348_355" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>In December, 1893, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Postmaster General to modify the rules governing fines for being
late at duty. In February, 1899, Mr. Maddison made a similar
request.<a href="#Footnote_349_356" id="FNanchor_349_356" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>In October, 1902, Mr. Palmer intervened on behalf of some &ldquo;learners&rdquo;
at Reading, who had been punished &ldquo;for careless performance of their
duties, leading to serious delay in the delivery of telegrams.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_350_357" id="FNanchor_350_357" class="fnanchor">350</a>
Mr. Palmer, a biscuit manufacturer, was the Member for Reading. In the
past he had been an Alderman as well as the Mayor of Reading.</p>

<p>In July, 1901, Mr. Groves intervened on behalf of a postman at
Manchester from whom annual increments of pay had been withheld under
the rules governing irregular attendance.<a href="#Footnote_351_358" id="FNanchor_351_358" class="fnanchor">351</a> Mr. Groves is
Chairman of the South Salford Conservative Association.</p>

<p>In April, 1900, Mr. Steadman said: &ldquo;I honestly admit that this
question business might be overdone; but at the same time, if anyone,
postman or anyone else, thinks I can do his case any good by putting
down a question, I shall always do so as long as I am a Member of this
House.&rdquo; Mr. Steadman proved as good as his boast; and in July, 1900,
he intervened on behalf of a man from whom the Post Office Department
had withheld two good conduct stripes &ldquo;because he had absented himself
frequently on insufficient plea of illness.&rdquo; Mr. Steadman stood ready
to shield any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
malingerer who might apply to him, though malingering is a serious evil
in the Post Office service. For example, in 1901 the average number
of days&rsquo; absence on sick-leave was 7.6 days for the men in that part
of the staff that receives full pay during sick-leave, as against 5.2
days for the men in that part of the staff that receives only half-pay
during sick-leave.<a href="#Footnote_352_359" id="FNanchor_352_359" class="fnanchor">352</a> Mr. Steadman had been elected to Parliament
by a majority of 20 votes. He is at present a Member of the London
County Council.<a href="#Footnote_353_360" id="FNanchor_353_360" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>In June, 1906, Mr. Sydney Buxton, who had become Postmaster General,
upon the formation of the Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman Ministry, in
December, 1905, expressed himself as follows:<a href="#Footnote_354_361" id="FNanchor_354_361" class="fnanchor">354</a> &ldquo;He was informed a
little while ago by his private secretary that in the ordinary way 60
or 70 applications of various sorts were made by honorable Members
in the course of a calendar month, but that for some months past, in
consequence perhaps of there being a new Government, a new Parliament,
new Members, and a new Postmaster General, the number of applications
of all sorts had amounted to between 300 and 400 per month.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>A Member of the Select Committee on Post Office Servants, 1906</em></div>

<p>In May, 1906, Mr. J. Ward, a Member of the Select Committee on
Post Office Servants, 1906, asked the Postmaster General &ldquo;whether his
attention had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
called to the dismissal of E. C. Feasey, of Walsall, who had been an
efficient officer in the postal service for 17 years &hellip; and
whether he will reconsider the question of the man&rsquo;s reinstatement?&rdquo;
Mr. Buxton replied: &ldquo;I have looked into the circumstances connected
with the dismissal by my predecessor of E. C. Feasey, formerly a town
postman at Walsall. I find that Feasey had a most unsatisfactory
record&hellip;. I am not prepared to consider the question of
reinstatement.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_355_362" id="FNanchor_355_362" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>In March, 1906, the Postmaster General, in reply to Mr.
Nannetti, M. P., said: &ldquo;The Reports and statements in the
Corcoran case were fully considered at the time [1901], and I
can see no good purpose in reopening the matter after a lapse of
five years.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_356_363" id="FNanchor_356_363" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p>In April, 1906, Mr. Wiles,<a href="#Footnote_357_364" id="FNanchor_357_364" class="fnanchor">357</a> M. P., intervened
on behalf of the head messenger in the Secretary&rsquo;s Office at the
General Post Office, London. Under the administration of Lord Stanley,
Postmaster General, an allowance of 4 shillings a week given the head
messenger at the time of his appointment, had been withheld from
October, 1900, to October, 1905. Mr. Sydney Buxton replied: &ldquo;I have
already had this case under my consideration. The allowance of 4
shillings a week is being granted, but unfortunately the allowance
cannot be made retrospective.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wiles had been elected to Parliament in January, 1906, having
defeated Sir Albert K. Rollit, who, for many years, had made a
specialty of championing the cause of Post Office employees who had a
grievance.</p>

<p>In April, 1902, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, and representative in the House of Commons of the Postmaster
General, the Marquis of Londonderry, said: &ldquo;In a great administration
like this there must be decentralization, and how difficult it is to
decentralize, either in the Post Office or in the Army, when working
under constant examination by question and answer in this House, no
honorable Member who has not had experience of official life can easily
realize. But there must be decentralization, because every little petty
matter cannot be dealt with by the Postmaster General or the Permanent
Secretary to the Post Office. Their attention should be reserved in
the main for large questions, and I think it is deplorable, absolutely
deplorable, that so much of their time should be occupied, as under the
present circumstances it necessarily is occupied, with matters of very
small detail, because these matters of detail are asked by honorable
Members, and because we do not feel an honorable Member will accept an
answer from anyone but the highest authority. I think a third of the
time&mdash;I am putting it at a low estimate&mdash;of the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
officials in the Post Office is occupied in answering questions raised
by Members of this House, and in providing me with information in
order that I may be in a position to answer the inquiries addressed
to me&rdquo; concerning matters which, &ldquo;in any private business, would be
dealt with by the officer on the spot, without appeal or consideration
unless grievous cause were shown.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_358_365" id="FNanchor_358_365" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p>In March, 1903, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Postmaster General, read
the following Post Office Rule: &ldquo;A postmaster is to address to his
surveyor, and a subordinate officer is to address to the postmaster
(who will forward it to his surveyor), any application from himself
having reference to his duties or pay, or any communications he may
desire to make relating to official matters; and if the applicant is
dissatisfied with the result he may appeal direct to the Postmaster
General. But it is strictly forbidden to make any such application or
other communication through the public, or to procure one to be made by
Members of Parliament, or others; and should an irregular application
be received, the officer on whose behalf it is made will be subject to
censure or punishment proportionate to the extent of his participation
in the violation of the rule.&rdquo; Mr. Chamberlain added: &ldquo;But it has been
my practice [as well as that of Mr. Chamberlain&rsquo;s predecessors] to
treat the rule as applying only to applications so made in the first
instance, and I have raised no objection
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
to an officer who had appealed to me, and was dissatisfied
with my decision, applying subsequently to a Member of
Parliament.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_359_366" id="FNanchor_359_366" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>The Post Office is not the only British Department of State which is
obliged to consider with care how far it may go counter to individual
interests in enforcing rules and standards adopted for the preservation
of the public interest.</p>

<p>Before the Select Committee on National Expenditure, 1902, Sir John
Eldon Gorst, M. P., and Vice-President of the Committee of Council
on Education, 1895 to 1902, said: &ldquo;What I want to impress upon the
Committee is that Parliament has never an influence which goes for
economy of any kind in the expenditure of public money on education
[about $40,000,000 a year]. Then I hope I have now shown the Committee
that the only security the public has that what it spends will be
efficiently spent is the system of inspection. Earlier in my evidence
I also pointed out the two systems which are in vogue for inspection,
namely the South Kensington system and the Whitehall system. The
Whitehall system, which deals with the larger amount of public
money, is extremely inefficient. The Elementary Education Inspectors
have before their eyes the fear, first of all, of the managers of
the schools which they visit. The managers of the schools are often
important School Boards like the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
School Board of London, which is not a body to be trifled with, which
has very great influence, both in Parliament and in the Education
Department, and which the Inspectors are very much afraid of offending.
But it is not only powerful School Boards, but any managers [of
schools] can take the matter up. If an Inspector goes into a school
and sees [reports] that the children are dirty, or that the school is
dirty, or that the teacher is inefficient, the manager is up in arms
at once, and writes a letter to the Board of Education, and comes up
and sees the Secretary, and protests against the Inspector for having
dared to make an unfavorable report of his or her school. Besides that,
the Inspectors have before their eyes the fear of the National Union of
Teachers. Almost every teacher now is a member of the National Union
of Teachers, and if an Inspector is supposed to be severe, a teacher
complains at once to the National Union, and the case is taken up,
possibly even in Parliament, by some of the officials of the National
Union of Teachers in Parliament, and it is made very uncomfortable
for the Inspector. Then, lastly, they [<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span>, the Inspectors] have
the office&mdash;that is not, say, their own Chief Inspector, but
the officials of the office, who do not like an Inspector who makes
trouble. The great art of an Inspector is to get on well with the
managers [of schools] and teachers, and to make no trouble at all. I
have known cases of adverse reports which were not liked at the office
being sent back to the Inspector to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
alter,&rdquo; not by the Chief Inspector, or Senior Inspector
of the District, but by some other person in the
office.<a href="#Footnote_360_367" id="FNanchor_360_367" class="fnanchor">360</a></p>

<p>Sir John Eldon Gorst was Solicitor-General in 1885-86, Under
Secretary for India in 1886 to 1891, Financial Secretary to the
Treasury in 1891-92, Deputy Chairman of Committees of the House of
Commons in 1888 to 1891, and Vice-President of Council on Education in
1885 to 1902. He was a Member of the House of Commons in 1866 to 1868,
and has been a member continuously since 1875. Since 1892 he has sat as
representative of the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Sir John Eldon Gorst was by no means unwilling to take his share
of blame for the mismanagement in the various Departments of State
arising out of the intervention of the House of Commons&mdash;under
pressure from the constituencies, or organized groups in the
constituencies&mdash;in the administrative details of the Departments
of State. He said: &ldquo;I have been as great a sinner as anyone in
the days when I represented Chatham,<a href="#Footnote_361_368" id="FNanchor_361_368" class="fnanchor">361</a> before I was a
Member of the Government; I was perpetually urging the Secretary
of the Admiralty for the time being to increase the expenditures
at the dockyards&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_362_369" id="FNanchor_362_369" class="fnanchor">362</a> [in the interest of the laborers in the
dockyards and of the merchants and manufacturers who have raw materials

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">
   CHAPTER XVII <br /><span class="smcap">The Spirit of the Civil
   Service</span>
</h2>
<div class="blockquot">
   <p>The doctrine of an &ldquo;implied contract&rdquo; between the State
   and each civil servant, to the effect that the State may
   make no change in the manner of administering its great
   trading departments without compensating every civil servant
   however remotely or indirectly affected. The hours of
   work may not be increased without compensating every one
   affected. Administrative &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; may not be corrected
   without compensating the past beneficiaries of such
   mistakes. Violation of the order that promotion must not
   be mechanical, or by seniority alone, may not be corrected
   without compensating those civil servants who would have
   been benefitted by the continued violation of the aforesaid
   order. The State may not demand increased efficiency of its
   servants without compensating every one affected. Persons
   filling positions for which there is no further need, must
   be compensated. Each civil servant has a &ldquo;vested right&rdquo; to
   the maintenance of such rate of promotion as obtains when he
   enters the service, irrespective of the volume of business or
   of any diminution in the number of higher posts consequent
   upon administrative reforms. The telegraph clerks demand that
   their chances of promotion be made as good as those of the
   postal clerks proper, but they refuse to avail themselves of
   the opportunity to pass over to the postal side proper of
   the service, on the ground that the postal duties proper are
   more irksome than the telegraph duties. Members of Parliament
   support recalcitrant telegraph clerks whom the Government is
   attempting to force to learn to perform postal duties, in
   order that it may reap advantage from having combined the
   postal service and the telegraph service in 1870. Special
   allowances may not be discontinued; and vacations may not
   be shortened, without safeguarding all &ldquo;vested interests.&rdquo;
   Further illustrations of the hopelessly unbusinesslike spirit
   of the rank and file of the public servants.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon a preceding page has been mentioned the contention of the
civil servants that there is an implied contract between the State and
the Civil Service that the conditions of employment obtaining at any
moment shall not be changed to the disadvantage of the civil servants,
except upon payment of compensation to all persons disadvantageously
affected; and that unless such compensation is paid, any change in the
conditions and terms of employment must be limited to future entrants
upon the service of the State, or to persons who shall accept promotion
on the express condition of becoming subject to the altered terms of
employment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Implied Contract for Six Hour Day</em></div>

<p>Before the Select Committee on Civil Services Expenditure, 1873, Mr.
W. E. Baxter, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: &ldquo;I am not an
advocate for long hours; and in the mercantile business with which I am
connected, I have years ago reduced the hours both of the clerks and of
the workmen, but I am inclined to think the six hours given to their
work by the Government officials [that is, Upper and Lower Division
clerks], rather too short a period, and that it might with advantage
be somewhat lengthened. At the same time we must always keep in mind
that the effect of lengthening the hours would be to cause an immediate
demand for an increase of pay. However I have a very strong impression
that in most of the Government offices there are too many clerks, and
that there might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
be considerable economy in a reduction of numbers and an increase of
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated to the Committee that
it would be inexpedient to try to raise the hours of clerks
from 6 hours to, say, 7 hours. He said: &ldquo;I suspect that my
one-seventh more time would be more than compensated by my having
to pay them a great deal more than one-seventh more salary; and
I think it would be very perilous to take up the floodgates in
that way.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_363_370" id="FNanchor_363_370" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>Before the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the Civil
Establishments, 1888, Sir Reginald E. Welby, Permanent Secretary to
the Treasury, stated that he was in favor of extending the hours of
the Upper and Lower Division clerks from 6 hours to 7. The Chairman
queried: &ldquo;But can it be done with existing clerks without a breach of
faith?&rdquo; Sir R. E. Welby replied: &ldquo;With regard to Lower Division clerks,
it is provided that in consideration of an extra payment, which is
according to the regulation, a 6 hour office can be turned into a 7
hour office&hellip;. There is no provision of that kind for the Upper
Division, and, of course, any change would have to be made a matter of
consideration&hellip;. The arrangement made between the authorities
of the Inland Revenue and the Treasury, in those departments of the
Inland Revenue which have adopted the 7 hours system, has been that the
clerks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
who were under no stipulation to do 7 hours&rsquo; work, should have an extra
allowance until promotion. As soon as they are promoted to another
class, we have assumed that we have the right to put our conditions
upon the promotion, and, therefore, from that time they fall into the
ordinary scale of salary without addition.&rdquo; At this point Mr. H. H.
Fowler, a Member of the Commission, queried: &ldquo;I understand you to say
there is no provision made for altering the period of service of an
Upper Division clerk from 6 hours to 7 hours. I want to know where is
the document by which the State binds itself over to accept 6 hours&rsquo;
work &hellip;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nowhere. The only thing is that when he enters the
office he is told that the hours are from 10 to 4, or from 11 to
5.&rdquo; Mr. Fowler continued: &ldquo;I consider this is a question of vital
importance, and I want to have it very distinctly from you: I want to
know where is the contract between the State and any Upper Division
clerk in any department, that he is only to work 6 hours a day?&rdquo; &ldquo;There
is no such document that I know of, and no such understanding further
than the statement upon his entering the office that the hours are such
and such.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I want to ascertain whether there would be even an
approach to a breach of faith (if such a term may be used) if the State
says: &lsquo;We insist upon our servants working for us 7 hours a day?&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;None in my mind, and I may add that it is generally known that the
hours are so and so, but longer hours when required&rdquo; [on exceptionally
busy days].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>To Sir T. H. Farrer, Permanent Secretary to the
Board of Trade, 1867 to 1886, the Chairman of the Royal
<del>Commissoin</del><ins>commission</ins> said: &ldquo;What is your view
with reference to its being fair or necessary to increase the pay if
seven hours&rsquo; work be asked from an Upper Division clerk. Do you think
there is any contract to do only 6 hours&rsquo; work?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, there is no
contract whatever; theoretically the rule is that civil servants are
to do the business that is required of them. The practical difficulty
remains that if you do it you may have a great uproar. You may cause
discontent, and you may have, as I said before, pressure in the House
of Commons; but theoretically, and as a matter of right, I can see
no reason why every officer should not be obliged to give 7 hours
for the existing pay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you not to some extent recognized it<a href="#Footnote_364_371" id="FNanchor_364_371" class="fnanchor">364</a>
by creating a different scale of pay in the Lower Division for 7
hours than for 6 hours?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, you have, and I am very sorry for it;
when I say you have, I was a party to it,<a href="#Footnote_365_372" id="FNanchor_365_372" class="fnanchor">365</a> but I am sorry that
we did it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But you are of course of opinion that when you announce
that the office hours are from 10 to 4, it means that these are the
hours of public attendance, but that it does not in any way prevent the
head of the office from asking the clerks to stop until the work is
done?&rdquo; &ldquo;No; but the larger your class of Lower Division clerks, the more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
you will find that the hours become fixed hours, and if they are
asked to attend beyond them [because of unusual pressure of work],
they will ask for extra pay for attendance.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_366_373" id="FNanchor_366_373" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Clerks are Clerks</em></div>

<p>In 1881, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, created for the provincial
towns the class of &ldquo;telegraph clerks,&rdquo; who are recruited from the
first class of telegraphists, and act as assistants to the assistant
superintendents. Since the men in question were styled clerks, they
immediately contended that their hours of work should be reduced from
8 hours a day to 39 hours a week, the hours of the clerks proper.
The Department always has refused to recognize that claim. But Mr.
Beaufort, Postmaster at Manchester, acting on a misreading of the
rules, from 1884 to 1890 granted the telegraph clerks at Manchester
the 39 hours a week. In 1892 the hours were raised to the correct
number, namely 8 hours a day, with half an hour for a meal. In 1896,
9 telegraph clerks from Manchester sent a spokesman to the Tweedmouth
Committee to state that they had become telegraph clerks in 1890,
when the hours were 35 a week, and that they deemed it a &ldquo;hardship&rdquo;
to be compelled to work 8 hours a day.<a href="#Footnote_367_374" id="FNanchor_367_374" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1902, Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to
the Treasury, stated in the House of Commons: &ldquo;The town postmen at
Newton Abbot were formerly paid on too high a scale [in consequence
of an error of judgment made by a departmental officer]. The wages
were accordingly reduced some years ago, but the postmen then in
the service were allowed to retain their old scale of payment so
long as they should remain in the service, and the new scale was
applied only to postmen who entered the service subsequently. This
will account for there being temporarily two scales for postmen at
Newton Abbott.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_368_375" id="FNanchor_368_375" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Standard of Efficiency should not be Raised</em></div>

<p>In 1881, Mr. Fawcett, Postmaster General, established for
Metropolitan London the class of &ldquo;senior telegraphists,&rdquo; with a salary
rising by annual increments of $40, from $800 to $950. He intended
that this class should be filled by the promotion of men from the
first class of telegraphists who possessed exceptional manipulative
efficiency as well as sufficient executive ability to act as assistants
to the assistant superintendents. But as a matter of fact many men
were promoted to this class by mere seniority and without reference to
their qualifications. In 1890, however, under Mr. Raikes, Postmaster
General, the Department resolved to promote to the senior class
no more men who were not fully qualified.<a href="#Footnote_369_376" id="FNanchor_369_376" class="fnanchor">369</a> And in 1894, the
Department
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
imposed a technical examination<a href="#Footnote_370_377" id="FNanchor_370_377" class="fnanchor">370</a> between the first
class of telegraphists and the senior class, in order to insure that
all men promoted to the senior class should have the qualifications
required of them. Mr. H. C. Fischer, Controller of the London Central
Telegraph Office, said of this examination: &ldquo;It is not considered
unjust that this should have been enforced in the case of men who had
always been employed on instrument duties, and who had only themselves
to blame if they neglected to acquire some knowledge of technical
matters, which all skilled telegraphists
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
are expected to possess&hellip;. Even before the institution of the
examination it was always held that the possession of technical
knowledge gave the man an additional claim to promotion to the
senior class.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_371_378" id="FNanchor_371_378" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee the representatives of the first
class telegraphists complained of the technical examination as a
&ldquo;grievance.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;The regulation came into operation at once,
an act which is regarded as exceptionally unjust toward men of more
than 20 years&rsquo; service, who, up to that time had understood from the
general practice of the Department, that, other things being equal,
good conduct and manipulative efficiency would secure promotion.
Now, however, the possession of technical knowledge is added as a
necessary qualification before promotion to the senior class, and
this without a coincident rise in the maximum [salary] of the first
class as compensation for the additional demand upon the capacity
of the staff.&rdquo; As the alternative to the raising of the maximum
salary of the first class [$800], &ldquo;it was earnestly contended that
the scale to which the officer is raised on passing the examination
should be materially enhanced [beyond the present maximum of $950]
in recompense for the further additional demand upon his time, and
for his pecuniary outlay in preparing himself for the requirements
of the Department.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_372_379" id="FNanchor_372_379" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Prior to November, 1886, special intelligence was required of
the sorters of foreign letters in the London Central Post Office,
who were correspondingly well paid. The wages of the first class
of sorters of foreign letters began at $13.75 a week, and rose to
$17.50, by triennial increments of $1.25 a week. Those of the second
class began at $11.25, and rose to $13.75, by annual increments of
$0.50 a week. But in consequence of a material simplification of the
duties of the foreign letter sorters, consequent upon the changes
in the international postage charges, the Department resolved, in
November, 1886, to replace the two classes of sorters of foreign
letters by one class, with wages ranging from $12.50 a week to $15.<a href="#Footnote_373_380" id="FNanchor_373_380" class="fnanchor">373</a>
It was provided, however, that the existing sorters of the first class
should retain the old scale of wages; and that the existing sorters of
the second class should have the option of immediate promotion to the
new class, with wages rising from $12.50 to $15, or, &ldquo;of being advanced
to the $13.75 to $17.50 scale, in the order in which they would have
attained to that scale if the old first class scale had not been
abolished.&rdquo; In other words, the men who, prior to November, 1886, had
been in line for ultimate promotion to a class carrying wages of $13.75
to $17.50, were offered the option &ldquo;of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
being regarded as having a vested interest to rise to $17.50
a week, as vacancies should occur.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_374_381" id="FNanchor_374_381" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Claim of Exemption from Vicissitudes of Life</em></div>

<p>In 1895, Mr. H. B. Irons, a second class sorter in London, appeared
before the Tweedmouth Committee to present the grievance of himself
and colleagues, who, prior to 1886, had given up the position of
first class letter carriers to become second class letter sorters
in order to improve their prospects of promotion. The grievance was
that the prospects of promotion of letter sorters had been curtailed
by the abolition of the sorterships of foreign letters in 1886, and
the abolition of the sortership of the first class of inland and
foreign newspapers in 1890. Mr. Irons alleged that he would have
remained a letter carrier had he foreseen the changes in question.<a href="#Footnote_375_382" id="FNanchor_375_382" class="fnanchor">375</a>
His argument was that the civil servant must be exempt from the
ordinary chances and vicissitudes of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1890 some senior telegraphists protested that they ought to be
made assistant superintendents, alleging that they were performing the
duties of assistant superintendents. Mr. Raikes, Postmaster General,
found that some of the duties of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
complainants were of the nature alleged, but not all of them.
Therefore, he made the complainants, forty-nine in number, second class
assistant superintendents. By 1896, this new class had come to number
sixty-five.</p>

<p>From 1881 to 1890, the proportion borne by the senior telegraphists
to the first class and second class telegraphists had ranged between 1
to 6.6 and 1 to 7.7. The promotion of forty-nine senior telegraphists
in 1890, and of the others in subsequent years, raised the proportion
in question to 1 to 10, in 1895. But counting senior telegraphists and
second class assistant superintendents, there was, in 1895, one of
these superior officers to each 6.5 of first class and second class
telegraphists. In other words, the rate of promotion of first class
and second class telegraphists to appointments superior to the first
class of telegraphists, but inferior to the position of assistant
superintendent, had been more rapid in 1891 to 1895, than it had been
in 1881 to 1890.</p>

<p>In 1895, Mr. Nicholson, Chairman London Branch of the Postal
Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association, appeared before the Tweedmouth
Committee to voice the grievance of the first class and second class
telegraphists, which was, that the rate of promotion from the second
class and first class had decreased, as shown by the fact that there
was only one senior telegraphist to each ten first class and second
class telegraphists. Mr. Nicholson contended that the increase of
telegraphic messages consequent upon the introduction of the charge of
12 cents for 12 words had necessitated the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
creation of a new class, the second class superintendents; and
that the first class and second class telegraphists had a right
to demand that they should derive benefit from that increase of
traffic and that necessity of creating a new class of officers.
That the Department&rsquo;s failure to fill the vacancies created in
the senior class of telegraphists by promotions to the class of
second class superintendents, had deprived the first class and
second class telegraphists of all advantage arising out of the
creation of a new class of officers, the second class assistant
superintendents.<a href="#Footnote_376_383" id="FNanchor_376_383" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Right to Fixed Rate of Promotion</em></div>

<p>The nature of the claim made by the Chairman London Branch of
the Postal Telegraph Clerks&rsquo; Association is forcibly illustrated by
the following incident from the proceedings of the Royal Commission
on Civil Establishments, 1888. Mr. H. A. Davies, the official
representative of the clerks in the Receiver and Accountant General&rsquo;s
Office of the General Post Office, had made a similar demand on behalf
of the men whom he represented. The Chairman asked him: &ldquo;Does a man
enter the public service on the assumption that all the upper places
are to remain the same as when he enters&hellip;. If you and I enter
the public service finding a certain Department, the Post Office or
any other, with twenty posts above to which we had a reasonable hope,
if we behaved well, and showed merit; if administrative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
reform takes away five of these posts, are we entitled to compensation,
because that is what it [your allegation of grievance] comes to? Can
you say, there being no contract whatever between me and the State when
I entered the office as a clerk, no contract whatever that I should
attain to a higher post, except when there is a vacancy, that I have
a claim [to compensation] when administrative reform takes away some
of the other places?&rdquo; The spokesman of the Post Office clerks replied:
&ldquo;If I were defending that [position] to Parliament, I think I should
say that the country has a certain duty toward men who, when they
entered the service, had, judging by the precedents of their office,
a fair prospect of reasonable promotion, and that if any economy is
effected by subsequent administrative reforms, the sufferers deserve
some consideration.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_377_384" id="FNanchor_377_384" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From 1885 to 1888 Mr. Lawson, M. P.,<a href="#Footnote_378_385" id="FNanchor_378_385" class="fnanchor">378</a> was a Member of the
Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the Civil Establishments. In
March, 1889, he intervened in the administration of the Post Office
by asking the Postmaster General how many vacancies there were in the
first class of telegraphists at the Central Telegraph Office, London;
how long those vacancies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
had been open, and whether the Postmaster General had received a
petition from the second class telegraphists for their promotion;
and whether there was anything to prevent him from complying with
the request. The Postmaster General replied that on January 1, 1889,
there had been 53 vacancies. &ldquo;To thirty-four of those vacancies I have
made promotions within the last few days; and this, practically, is
an answer to the petition of December, 1888.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_379_386" id="FNanchor_379_386" class="fnanchor">379</a> The reader will
recall that in February, 1888, Mr. Lawson had intervened on behalf of
a letter carrier who had been dismissed in 1882. In 1889 to 1892, and
1897 to 1904, Mr. Lawson was a Member of the London County Council.</p>

<p>In June, 1902, Mr. Hay, M. P.,<a href="#Footnote_380_387" id="FNanchor_380_387" class="fnanchor">380</a> asked the Postmaster
General, through the Financial Secretary to the Treasury: &ldquo;With
reference to the fact that the proportion of appointments above $800
a year in the Central Telegraph Office, London, now bears the same
relation to the staff below that salary as during the period when
the circular [1881 to 1891] was issued promising a prospect of $950,
whether he is aware that during the years 1882 to 1892 the proportion
was one appointment above $800 to 5.5 below [that salary], and that
the proportion at the present time is one appointment above $800 to 6.4
below; and, seeing that this difference
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of proportion represents nearly forty appointments, above $800,
whether he will take steps to readjust that proportion on the basis
of 1 to 5.5?&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_381_388" id="FNanchor_381_388" class="fnanchor">381</a> In 1906, Mr. Hay was made a member of the
Select Committee on Post Office Servants.</p>

<p>In April and in August, 1902, Captain Norton asked the Postmaster
General, through the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to appoint
so many additional senior telegraphists that it should no longer be
necessary to call on men in the class below to act as substitutes
for the senior telegraphists who were taking their annual leave
of one month.<a href="#Footnote_382_389" id="FNanchor_382_389" class="fnanchor">382</a> In 1906, Captain Norton became a Junior Lord
of the Treasury in the Sir Campbell-Bannerman Ministry.</p>

<p>In February, 1902, Mr. Plummer<a href="#Footnote_383_390" id="FNanchor_383_390" class="fnanchor">383</a> stated that at
Newcastle-on-Tyne thirty-eight telegraphists, who had, on an average,
served 27 years each, were waiting for promotion. &ldquo;Will the Postmaster
General facilitate promotion by enforcing in the future the Civil
Service Regulation with reference to retirement<a href="#Footnote_384_391" id="FNanchor_384_391" class="fnanchor">384</a> at the age of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
sixty years?&rdquo; Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, replied: &ldquo;The Postmaster General would not feel justified
in enforcing the retirement of any efficient officers for the
purpose of accelerating the promotion of others.&rdquo; On August 1,
1902, Captain Norton repeated the request.<a href="#Footnote_385_392" id="FNanchor_385_392" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>On November 24, 1902, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien asked the Postmaster to create
more rapid promotion at Liverpool by retiring all men who had qualified
for the maximum pension [two-thirds of salary], irrespective of the
fitness of such men to continue to serve.<a href="#Footnote_386_393" id="FNanchor_386_393" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>On June 19, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked the Secretary to the
Treasury, as representing the Postmaster General: &ldquo;Whether he will
state the special qualifications which necessitate the retention in
the Postal service of the assistant superintendent, Mr. Napper, and
the inspector, Mr. Graham, at the West Central District Office, after
reaching 60 years of age; and if the probable date of retirement can
be given?&rdquo; On July 28, 1902, Mr. Keir Hardie asked: &ldquo;If he will state
what are the special qualifications which necessitate the retention
of the inspector, Mr. E. Stamp, at the North Western District
Office, after attaining the age of 60 years; and if he can give the
probable date of this officer&rsquo;s retirement?&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_387_394" id="FNanchor_387_394" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>Any officer who is retired with a pension, on account of ill health,
before he is sixty years of age, may, if he recovers his health, be
recalled to duty at the discretion of the head of his Department or of
the Treasury. Under such circumstances the officer receives the salary
of his new office and so much of his pension as shall be sufficient
to make his total income equal to the original pension. Under the
foregoing rule two officers were made respectively postmaster at
Bristol and postmaster at Hastings.</p>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee, Mr. Uren, President of the
Postmasters&rsquo; Association, protested against such &ldquo;blocking of some of
the best offices by pensioners&hellip;. Here are two good offices,
one with $4,000 a year, and the other with $2,750, which are taken
up by pensioners who recover their health, and so block a line of
promotion&hellip;. I only mention these as the two most recent cases
with which this sort of thing has happened, but they are not the
only occasions by a good many, which I am instructed to bring before
your Committee as a fair subject for consideration.&rdquo; Mr. Crosse,
another witness, added: &ldquo;The Postal Clerks&rsquo; Association also desire to
endorse the evidence put forward by the Postmasters&rsquo; Association as
to the anomaly and injustice of certain postmasters being retained
in the service who are in the receipt of pension and salary from
the Department.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_388_395" id="FNanchor_388_395" class="fnanchor">388</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mechanical Equality Demanded</em></div>

<p>Prior to August, 1891, the postmen of metropolitan London were
divided into two classes: the second class, with wages rising from
$4.50 a week to $6, by annual increments of $0.25 a week; and the
first class, with wages rising from $6 a week, to $7.50, by annual
increments of $0.25 a week. In consequence of the rapid growth of the
postal business, however, the postmen frequently passed through the
second class into the first class, not in six years, but in from two to
five years. But the rate of promotion from the second class into the
first differed materially in the several metropolitan branch offices,
because of the unequal growth of business at those several offices.
That inequality of promotion violated the ideal<a href="#Footnote_389_396" id="FNanchor_389_396" class="fnanchor">389</a> of the civil
servants, which is, that all should fare alike; and therefore, the
postmen demanded that the division into two classes be abolished, and
that every postman should rise, by stated annual increments, from the
initial wage of $4.50 to the final wage of $7.50. But the abolition
of classification would put an end to the possibility of those rapid
passings through the stages between $4.50 and $6 that had been of
frequent occurrence in the past in some of the metropolitan branch
offices. By way of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
compensation for the loss of that chance the postmen demanded that the
annual increment be increased beyond $0.25 a week.</p>

<p>The Department, in August, 1891, abolished the classification of the
postmen, but it refused to raise the annual increment. It said that
the rapid promotion from $4.50 to $6 that had characterized the past
had been an accident, that it had not been foreseen, and that the men
who had entered the service while it had obtained had not acquired a
vested right to it. In 1896 the men who had been postmen prior to the
abolition of classification appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee
with the statement that they &ldquo;were under the impression that it was an
official principle that no individual should suffer by the introduction
of a new scale of promotion or wages.&rdquo; They demanded compensation for
the fact that they had lost, in 1891, the possibility of passing in
less than the regular time from the wage of $4.50 to that of $6. They
stated that they were prepared to show that &ldquo;they had suffered material
pecuniary loss &hellip; amounting in some cases to about $500.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_390_397" id="FNanchor_390_397" class="fnanchor">390</a>
All of which goes to show that in the British Post Office service the
abolition of a grievance can in turn become a grievance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Equality, not Opportunity</em></div>

<p>Before the Tweedmouth Committee appeared also the representatives of
the telegraphers, to demand the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
abolition of the division of the telegraphers into classes, with
promotion by merit between the classes. They demanded amalgamation
into a single class, in which each one should pass automatically
from the minimum pay to the maximum, provided he was not arrested
by the efficiency bar, to be placed at $800 a year. Mr. E. B. L.
Hill, Assistant Secretary, General Post Office, London, began his
discussion of this demand by quoting with approval the conclusion
of the Telegraph Committee of 1893, which was: &ldquo;We have taken great
pains to investigate this matter. Almost without exception the
provincial postmasters and telegraph superintendents were opposed to an
amalgamation of the classes, and gave the strongest testimony to the
value of the present division [into classes] as a means of discouraging
indifference, and encouraging zeal and efficiency. We think &hellip;
that for purposes of discipline it is desirable to maintain the
division of the establishment into two classes.&rdquo; Mr. Hill continued
by saying that in the course of the last three or four years he had
changed his opinion, and had come to the conclusion that amalgamation
into one class must come. &ldquo;The staff seems to desire, first of all,
equality, and the abolition of classification seems to insure the
fulfillment of that wish. At the same time classification is a valuable
incentive to exertion and efficiency&hellip;.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_391_398" id="FNanchor_391_398" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Opportunities Rejected; Increased Pay Demanded</em></div>

<p>In 1896 the proportion borne by the supervising officers above the
rank of first class sorting clerks to the total staff of sorting clerks
was 18.85 per cent., whereas the proportion borne by the officers
above the rank of first class telegraphists to the total staff was
12.59 per cent. At the same time the proportion borne by the first
class clerks to the total of first and second class clerks was 20.17
per cent. on the postal side of the service, and 24.64 per cent. on
the telegraph side. In other words, the chances of promotion to a
supervising position are much better in the postal branch than in the
telegraph branch; so much so, that to an able and energetic man, the
postal branch is more attractive than the telegraph branch, even though
the chances of reaching a first class clerkship are somewhat better in
the telegraph branch than in the postal branch. But the letter sorting
clerk&rsquo;s work is more irksome than the work of the telegraphist, and
therefore &ldquo;the telegraphists are usually reluctant, notwithstanding the
better prospects of promotion, to accept work on the postal side.&rdquo; For
example, in the four years ending with 1896, only ten telegraphists at
Birmingham had themselves transferred to the postal side, and three of
those ten had themselves re-transferred to the instrument room, because
the work on the postal side proved too hard for them. Again, on March
6, 1896, Mr. Harley, the postmaster at Manchester, issued the following
notice: &ldquo;I should like to afford an opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
to telegraphists in this office of becoming acquainted with letter
sorting duties, and, with this view, if a sufficient number of officers
apply, I will arrange an evening duty of from 2 to 3 hours in the
sorting office for a month in every three, such duty to form a portion
of their 8 hours&rsquo; duty. About 50 officers would be required to enable
me to carry this suggestion into effect, and I shall be glad if all
officers who are disposed to avail themselves of this opportunity of
acquiring postal knowledge will submit their names.&rdquo; At the end of
three weeks Mr. Harley had not had a single response, though he had
in person explained to a number of &ldquo;representative telegraphists the
advantage which a knowledge of postal work would give them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The telegraphists, as a body, decline to avail themselves of the
opportunities offered them to improve their chances of promotion; none
the less they allege they have a grievance in the fact that their
chances of promotion are not so good as are the chances of the sorting
clerks. They demand that the Post Office redress their grievance,
either by increasing the number of telegraph supervising officers, or
by raising the salaries of the first and second class telegraphists
sufficiently to compensate the telegraphists for their smaller
chance of becoming supervising officers.<a href="#Footnote_392_399" id="FNanchor_392_399" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Parliamentary Intervention</em></div>

<p>The telegraphists even try to bring pressure on the Government
to stop the Post Office from forcing them to learn letter sorting.
For example, in 1896, the Post Office required the telegraphists and
sorters employed in the Oxford Central Post Office to work at the
pleasure of the Oxford postmaster at letter sorting or at telegraphing.
The Oxford telegraph clerks argued that they had contracts with the
Government to work as telegraph operators, and that the Government had
no right to force them either to do sorting, or to suffer transfer to
some other office where the convenience of the Government would not be
affected by their refusal to act as sorters. The clerks kept up their
agitation for years, and in December, 1902, they induced Mr. Samuel,<a href="#Footnote_393_400" id="FNanchor_393_400" class="fnanchor">393</a>
M. P., to champion their cause in the House of Commons.<a href="#Footnote_394_401" id="FNanchor_394_401" class="fnanchor">394</a>
Mr. Samuel, in 1895 and 1900, had contested unsuccessfully South
Oxfordshire. He took &ldquo;First Class Honors&rdquo; at Oxford, and he has
published: <cite>Liberalism, Its Principles and Purposes</cite>. In 1906,
Mr. Samuel became Under Home Secretary in the Campbell-Bannerman
Ministry.</p>

<p>In June, 1904, Mr. William Jones asked the Postmaster General:
&ldquo;Whether he is aware that for some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
time past endeavors have been made to compel the telegraph staff at
Oxford to perform postal duties, and that they have been informed that
they would be removed compulsorily to other offices in the event of
the men declining to perform those duties; and whether, in view of the
declaration of previous Postmasters General, that telegraphists who
had entered the service before 1896 are exempt from the performance
of postal work, he will explain the reasons for his action?&rdquo; Lord
Stanley, Postmaster General, replied: &ldquo;The telegraph work at Oxford
has of late considerably fallen off [in consequence of the competition
from the telephone], and there is consequently not sufficient work
to keep the officers in the telegraph office fully occupied. Their
services have therefore been utilized for the benefit of the Department
in such manner as the exigencies of the service require. All officers
of the Department are expected loyally to perform any work required
of them which they are capable of undertaking; and unless some means
can be found of utilizing the services of redundant telegraphists
at the offices where they are at present employed, a transfer to
another office is the only alternative.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_395_402" id="FNanchor_395_402" class="fnanchor">395</a> Mr. Jones had
sat in Parliament since 1895. He is a private tutor at Oxford; has
been assistant schoolmaster at Anglesey; and has served under the
London School Board.<a href="#Footnote_396_403" id="FNanchor_396_403" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>Within ten days of the Jones episode, Mr. Dobbie,<a href="#Footnote_397_404" id="FNanchor_397_404" class="fnanchor">397</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
who had just been sent to Parliament to represent Ayr Burghs,
Scotland, intervened on behalf of the Glasgow Post Office clerks, who
objected to being compelled to do dual duties.<a href="#Footnote_398_405" id="FNanchor_398_405" class="fnanchor">398</a> At about the same
time Mr. Henderson, who, before entering Parliament, had been a Member
of the Newcastle Town Council, intervened on behalf of one Chandler, a
sorting clerk and telegraphist at Middlesbrough, who had been informed
that his increment would be withheld because of his ignorance of
telegraphy. The Postmaster General replied: &ldquo;All the circumstances
of his case have already been examined more than once both by my
predecessor and myself, and I am quite satisfied that he has received
proper treatment.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_399_406" id="FNanchor_399_406" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>In October, 1906, Mr. Parker, M. P., intervened on behalf
of some telegraph clerks at Halifax who were being made to
sort letters.<a href="#Footnote_400_407" id="FNanchor_400_407" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>The Bradford Committee on Post Office Wages, 1904, reported:
&ldquo;&hellip;it was pointed out that in the larger offices promotion
is better on the Postal side&hellip;. This is admitted, though we
understand that it is open to any telegraphists to acquire a knowledge
of Postal business, and so qualify for promotion on either side. It is
found that this is not done, however, as the men prefer the Telegraph
work to the more irksome Postal duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sundry Vested Rights</em></div>

<p>The Post Office gives those counter men of London and Dublin who
receive or pay money over the counter, a risk allowance, for the
purpose of reimbursing them for any errors that they may make in
dealing with the public. No such allowance is given to the postal
clerks in any other city; nor are such allowances paid by railway
companies or other private employers. Upon the provincial Post Office
clerks making a demand for equal treatment with the London and Dublin
clerks, the Department decided to discontinue the allowances in
London and Dublin &ldquo;as to future entrants to the postal service,&rdquo; and
under &ldquo;the most sacred preservation of all existing interests.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_401_408" id="FNanchor_401_408" class="fnanchor">401</a>
The Tweedmouth Committee endorsed this resolution, with the statement
that &ldquo;the rights of existing holders of risk allowances should, of
course, in all cases be maintained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tweedmouth Committee suggested a new scale of pay for the
several kinds of letter sorters in London. That new scale was suggested
for two reasons: for the purpose of discontinuing the complex system of
special allowances that had sprung up; and for the purpose of reducing
the pay of several classes of sorters, the existing scale of payment
being too high. The Committee proposed that all existing rights be
safeguarded, saying: &ldquo;Present holders of allowances should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
enter the [new] scale of salary at a point equal to their
previous salary and allowances combined, and wherever the maximum
of the present scale together with the allowances exceeds the
maximum of the new scale, that, but no further excess, should
be granted.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_402_409" id="FNanchor_402_409" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>The Tweedmouth Committee also reported: &ldquo;We think that the holidays
of the Dublin and Edinburgh [telegram] tracers should for the future be
14 week days, the same period as London men performing the same duties,
instead of 3 weeks as at present, the change as to holidays of course
not applying to present members of the class.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_403_410" id="FNanchor_403_410" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>The Tweedmouth Committee concluded that the holidays given to the
letter sorters and the telegraphists in London and in the provincial
towns were excessive. It proposed that the annual vacation of 21 week
days during the first 5 years of service and of one month after 5 years
of service, be reduced, to respectively 14 week days and 21 week days.
It added: &ldquo;It is not, however, suggested that this change should apply
to those officers already in the service who receive a leave of 3 weeks
during the first 5 years, nor is it proposed to curtail the leave
granted to those officers who have already served 5 years, and are,
therefore, in enjoyment of a month&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_404_411" id="FNanchor_404_411" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments, 1888, Sir
Reginald E. Welby, Secretary to the Treasury, testified that throughout
the Civil Service the Upper Division Clerks had 48 working days&rsquo;
vacation a year, besides the usual holidays. He said that but for
custom, which had become &ldquo;almost common law,&rdquo; there was no reason
for giving such a &ldquo;very liberal&rdquo; annual vacation. But he added that
any change should be made to apply only to future entrants to the
public service.<a href="#Footnote_405_412" id="FNanchor_405_412" class="fnanchor">405</a></p>

<p>In 1892 the Department increased from 21 week days, to one calendar
month, the annual leave of all men in the Central Post Office, London,
who were in receipt of $750 a year, or more. In the following year,
1893, the Department gave the same increase to men with $750 a year,
or more, in the branch offices of Metropolitan London, and in the
offices of the provincial towns. In 1895 the representatives of the
men who had not obtained the increase of annual leave until 1893,
appeared before the Tweedmouth Committee with the demand for ten
days&rsquo; pay by way of compensation for the fact that, in 1892, they had
&ldquo;lost ten days.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_406_413" id="FNanchor_406_413" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

<p>The tenacity with which the civil servants resist any change in
the conditions of service that is to their advantage, is further
illustrated by the following incidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>Down to 1880, the overseers in the postal service, who are on
their feet all day, had one day a week of relief from duty. In
1880 that allowance was reduced to half a day; and in 1893 it
was discontinued altogether. In each case the change was made to
apply only to the future entrants upon the office of overseer. In
1896 the new entrants upon the office still were complying under
protest only with the requirement of the Department that they sign
a paper stating that they were not entitled to any weekly &ldquo;relief
leave of absence.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_407_414" id="FNanchor_407_414" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>There are four Monday Bank Holidays in the year; and for several
years prior to 1892, the Telegraph Branch, as an act of grace, gave
a Saturday holiday to those &ldquo;news distributors&rdquo; whose services could
be spared on the Saturdays preceding Monday Bank Holidays. In 1892 it
ceased to be possible to continue this act of grace without employing
men on over-time, and therefore the practice was discontinued. In
1896 the news distributors complained before the Tweedmouth Committee
that the withdrawal of &ldquo;the days of grace was a grievance with which
they would like the Committee to grapple.&rdquo; The spokesman of the news
distributors said: &ldquo;After having enjoyed the privilege for [several]
years it was withdrawn, an arbitrary course, almost, it is thought,
without precedent. To
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
grant a privilege, and then take it away, displayed a lamentable want
of that courtesy that we think should be inseparable qualities of
power and position.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_408_415" id="FNanchor_408_415" class="fnanchor">408</a></p>

that would be better for the civil service and better for the boy

in such an unsatisfactory state that it would be very difficult to
defend the action of the Treasury in various matters connected with
it.&rdquo; Thereupon Mr. West, a Member of the Committee, queried: &ldquo;Acting in
accordance with that view last year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
endeavored to reform the system as to existing judges and as to future
judges, did he not&hellip;? Is that reform being now pursued with
regard to the existing judges?&rdquo; The Financial Secretary to the Treasury
replied: &ldquo;Not in regard to existing judges. I have always been of
opinion that it is very difficult to go back upon arrangements which
have been made in the past, however injurious to the public service
and uneconomical they may have been, and that it would be better for
economists [persons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
desiring to effect economy] to direct their attention to preventing
new arrangements of a similar character.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_413_420" id="FNanchor_413_420" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Unbusinesslike Spirit Further Illustrated</em></div>

<p>The thoroughly unbusinesslike spirit of the postal employees is
illustrated still further in the following &ldquo;grievance&rdquo; laid before the
Tweedmouth Committee by the official representatives of the postal
employees, who spoke, not as individuals, but as the instructed
representatives of their respective classes of public servants.</p>

<p>Mr. G. McDonald presented the grievance of the &ldquo;news distributors,&rdquo;
who &ldquo;are the picked men of the Telegraph Service, chosen on the ground
of exceptional merit.&rdquo; He complained that there was not sufficient
opportunity for promotion, since [the automatic] promotion was limited
to postmasterships worth from $1,000 to $1,250 a year, and there were
not enough postmasterships of that kind. Mr. McDonald admitted that
men under 35 years &ldquo;by competitive examination,&rdquo; could rise out of the
class of News Distributors to surveyors&rsquo; clerkships; but he argued
that since such promotion was attained by competitive examination,
&ldquo;it must be credited to the man himself who wins his position, and I
therefore beg to suggest that it cannot count as promotion in the
ordinary sense.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_414_421" id="FNanchor_414_421" class="fnanchor">414</a></p>

<p>Another grievance of the News Distributors was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
that they were not &ldquo;treated and classed&rdquo; as Major Division Clerks,
though they were paid on the scale of such clerks. They were compelled
to work 48 hours a week, whereas Major Division Clerks worked only
39 hours a week.<a href="#Footnote_415_422" id="FNanchor_415_422" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Boulden presented the telegraphists&rsquo; grievances as to
pensions. He demanded that retirement on pension should be optional at
the age of fifty; and that if a man died in harness, such deduction
as had been made from his salary toward the pension fund, should be
paid to his heir-at-law. Mr. H. C. Fischer, Controller London Central
Telegraph Office, replied that &ldquo;optional retirement at 50 years of
age would result in the more healthy members of the staff retiring at
that age, and seeking other employment to add to their income, leaving
the less healthy and less useful persons to hang on in the service as
long as they could.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_416_423" id="FNanchor_416_423" class="fnanchor">416</a></p>

<p>Mr. A. W. North presented another grievance, namely, that a female
telegraph clerk can become a female superintendent in 21 years, whereas
a male telegraph clerk can reach the corresponding position only after
27 years of service.<a href="#Footnote_417_424" id="FNanchor_417_424" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Malingerers&rsquo; Grievance</em></div>

<p>Mr. J R. Lickfold appeared as the representative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
of the postal employees to demand that in the case of an employee
having failed to appear for duty, the Department should accept without
any inquiry whatever the medical certificate of any physician. At this
time it was the practice of the Department to doubt the genuineness
of the illness and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fides</span> of a medical certificate only in
case &ldquo;the man had a bad record for frequent short sick absences,&rdquo;
&ldquo;though it was a well known fact that private [physicians&rsquo; as
distinguished from departmental physicians&rsquo;] certificates could be
obtained for 12 cents without even the doctor seeing the patient, but
on a mere statement of his symptoms from somebody else.&rdquo; In support
of this request, Mr. Lickfold, as the instructed representative of
the postal employees, could make no better argument than to cite
the dismissal, early in 1894, of two railway Post Office sorters,
W&mdash;&mdash; and J&mdash;&mdash;. In the evidence in rebuttal, Mr.
J. C. Badcock, Controller London Postal Service, gave the following
account of the episode in question. W&mdash;&mdash; and J&mdash;&mdash;
were absent from duty from January 8 to 11 inclusive. On January
10 they sent in medical certificates dated the 8th, but the date
of one of the certificates had apparently been changed from the
9th. W&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s landlady testified that W&mdash;&mdash; and
J&mdash;&mdash; had returned to W&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s lodgings on the 8th,
shortly after the departure of the mail train, saying that they had
missed the mail, but saying nothing of illness. She added that both men
had been repeatedly at W&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s lodgings on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the 8th and 9th. Both W&mdash;&mdash; and J&mdash;&mdash; were absent
from their lodgings during the greater part of the three days from the
8th to the 10th. The Post Office inspector found J&mdash;&mdash; in
bed on the night of the 10th. J&mdash;&mdash; told him he had not seen
W&mdash;&mdash; since the 6th, gave evasive answers, and contradicted
himself. The inspector also found W&mdash;&mdash; on the night of the
10th, and gave an equally unfavorable report upon W&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s
answers. On the 11th, the Departmental Medical Officer found both men
in W&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s room, and reported there was no reason why both
men should not have been on duty from the 8th to the 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer Walpole, Permanent Secretary of the Post Office and a
Member of the Committee, said to the witness: &ldquo;Have you any doubt that
the Department would not have taken the extreme course of dismissing
any of its servants on the divided opinion of two medical men, if
there had been no previous cases against them&hellip;? These men are
described as deliberate malingerers?&rdquo; The Chairman of the Committee
added: &ldquo;Do you not think it would be wise that before bringing forward
a particular case of this sort, you should inform yourself thoroughly
as to the nature of the case, and as to the character of the men to
whom you refer?&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_418_425" id="FNanchor_418_425" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very large portion of the evidence presented before the
Tweedmouth Committee, which evidence covered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
upward of a thousand closely printed folio pages, affords a melancholy
comment upon the theory which is rapidly spreading from the German
Universities over the English speaking countries, to wit, that the
extension of the functions of the State to the inclusion of business
enterprises automatically creates a public spirit which strengthens
the hands of the political leaders in charge of the State, even to the
point of enabling those leaders to reject the improper demands made
upon them by organized bodies of voters, and to administer the State&rsquo;s
business ventures with an eye single to the welfare of the community
as a whole, particularly the long-run interest of the taxpayers. The
so-called Norfolk-Hanbury compromise, the appointment and Report of
the Bradford Committee, and the appointment, in 1906, of the Select
Committee on Post Office Servants&mdash;the last act not having the
support, by speech or by vote, of a single man of first rate importance
in the House of Commons&mdash;are melancholy instances of what that
most discerning of statesmen, the late Marquis of Salisbury, used to
call &ldquo;the visible helplessness of Governments.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>Authoritative character of the evidence tendered by the
   several Secretaries of the Treasury. Testimony, in 1902, of
   Lord Welby, who had been in the Treasury from 1856 to 1894.
   Testimony of Sir George H. Murray, Permanent Secretary to the
   Post Office and sometime Private Secretary to the late Prime
   Minister, Mr. Gladstone. Testimony of Sir Ralph H. Knox, in
   the War Office since 1882. Testimony of Sir Edward Hamilton,
   Assistant Secretary to the Treasury since 1894. Testimony of
   Mr. R. Chalmers, a Principal Clerk in the Treasury; and of
   Sir John Eldon Gorst. Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s tribute to Joseph Hume,
   the first and last Member of the House of Commons competent
   to criticize effectively the details of expenditure of the
   State. Evidence presented before the Select Committee on Civil
   Services Expenditure, 1873.</p>
</div>

<p>Before proceeding to the subject proper of this chapter, it is
desirable to say a word about the organization and the work of
the Treasury.<a href="#Footnote_419_426" id="FNanchor_419_426" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>The Treasury consists of the First Lord of the Treasury, who is
almost invariably the Prime Minister; the Chancellor of the Exchequer;
and three Junior Lords of the Treasury. &ldquo;The Treasury is pre-eminently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a superintending and controlling office, and has properly no
administrative functions.&rdquo; Its duty is to reduce to, and maintain at,
the minimum compatible with efficiency, the expenditures of the several
Departments of State.</p>

<p>The Treasury has three Secretaries: the Financial Secretary, the
Parliamentary, or Patronage Secretary, and the Permanent Secretary.
The Financial Secretary, after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is the
political head and conductor of the Treasury. He is one of the hardest
worked officers of the Government. His duties were well described,
recently, by Mr. Austen Chamberlain, in the course of a brief sketch
of his official career. Said Mr. Chamberlain: &ldquo;From the Admiralty he
was transferred to the position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
where, as his chief explained to him, he was in the position of an old
poacher promoted to be gamekeeper, and his first duty was to unlearn
the habits of five years and save money where previously it had been
his pleasure to spend it.&rdquo; The Parliamentary, or Patronage Secretary
is the principal Government Whip. &ldquo;He is a very useful and important
functionary. His services are indispensable to the Leader of the House
of Commons in the control of the House and the management of public
business.&rdquo; &ldquo;It devolves upon him, under the direction of the Leader
of the House, &lsquo;to facilitate, by mutual understanding, the conduct
of public business,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the management of the House of Commons, a
position
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
which requires consummate knowledge of human nature, the most amiable
flexibility, and complete self-control.&rsquo;&rdquo; As &ldquo;Whipper-in,&rdquo; the
Parliamentary Secretary is generally assisted by two of the Junior
Lords of the Treasury, who are, at the same time, Government Whips.
&ldquo;Those useful functionaries are expected to gather the greatest number
of their own party into every division [of the House of Commons], and
by persuasion, promises, explanation, and every available expedient,
to bring their men from all quarters to the aid of the Government
upon any emergency. It is also their business to conciliate the
discontented and doubtful among the ministerial supporters, and to
keep every one, as far as possible, in good humor.&rdquo; &ldquo;An estimate
of the importance of the duties which would naturally devolve upon
these functionaries&mdash;from the increasing interference of the
House of Commons in matters of detail, and the necessity for the
continual supervision of some Member of the Government conversant with
every description of parliamentary business, in order to make sure
that the business is done in conformity to the views entertained by
the House&mdash;induced Sir Charles Wood,<a href="#Footnote_420_427" id="FNanchor_420_427" class="fnanchor">420</a> to declare, in 1850,
that the reduction of the number of Junior Lords from four to three was
a very doubtful advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>The Financial Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary are
political officers, that is, they sit in the House of Commons, and they
change with every change in the Government. The Permanent Secretary,
on the other hand, is a non-political officer, or civil servant, who
retains office through the successive changes of Government, and
secures the continuity of the office. He is the official head of the
Department, and of the whole civil service.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts make it clear that for the purposes of this
present discussion, one can cite no more authoritative personages than
the several Secretaries of the Treasury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Select Committee on National Expenditure, 1902, took a great
deal of evidence on the effect of the intervention of the House of
Commons in the administrative details of the several Departments of
State, particularly on the impairment of the power of the Treasury to
control the expenditure of the several Departments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lord Welby on Change in Public Opinion</em> </div>

<p>The most important witness was Lord Welby, who, as Mr. Welby, had
entered the Treasury in 1856; had been Head of the Finance Department
from 1871 to 1885; and had been Permanent Secretary from 1885 to 1894.
Lord Welby said that in theory the Treasury had full power of control
over the expenditures of the several Departments, but that in practice
that power of control
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
was limited by the state of public opinion as reflected in the House of
Commons. As soon as the Treasury became aware that it had not public
opinion at its back, that fact &ldquo;would have a certain influence on
many of its decisions.&rdquo; Then again, as soon as the other Departments
of State became aware that the Treasury was not supported by public
opinion, the authority of the Treasury over those Departments was
impaired. &ldquo;If an idea gets abroad that the House of Commons does not
care about economy, you will not find your servants economical.&rdquo;
Lord Welby then went on to say that in all the political parties in
the House of Commons, &ldquo;the old spirit of economy had been very much
weakened.&rdquo; He put the change of public opinion at about the middle
of the seventies, or, perhaps, rather later, say, in the eighties.
Previous to that change the influence of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer had been &ldquo;paramount, or very powerful, in the Cabinet.&rdquo; But
with the change in public opinion, &ldquo;the effective power of control in
the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been proportionately diminished.&rdquo;
Lord Welby concluded: &ldquo;I constantly hear it said now by people of great
weight that economy is impossible, that you cannot get the House of
Commons to pay attention [to counsels of economy]&hellip;. The main
object [to be striven after], I think, is that there should be some
correlation both in the minds of the Government of the day and in the
minds of the House of Commons between resources and expenditure; I
think that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
ought to exist, but I do not think it does exist at present. I see
no evidence of it.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_421_428" id="FNanchor_421_428" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hayes Fisher,<a href="#Footnote_422_429" id="FNanchor_422_429" class="fnanchor">422</a> a Member of the Committee, and Financial
Secretary to the Treasury, in 1902 to 1903, replied to Lord Welby:
&ldquo;But is not the business of the Treasury, and the main business of
the Treasury, to check that expenditure and keep it within reasonable
bounds, outside of questions of policy?&rdquo; Lord Welby replied: &ldquo;Quite
so; but might I venture to ask the honorable Member, who occupies one
of the most important posts in the Government, whether he would not be
glad of support in the House of Commons?&rdquo; &ldquo;Most certainly we should on
many occasions,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>Sir George H. Murray on Change in Public Opinion</em></div>

<p>Sir George H. Murray,<a href="#Footnote_423_430" id="FNanchor_423_430" class="fnanchor">423</a> Permanent Secretary
to the Post Office, was called as a witness because &ldquo;in the official
posts he had held, particularly as Private Secretary to the late
Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, he had had frequent opportunities for
observation not only of the reasons for expenditure, but of the control
exercised over it in Parliament.&rdquo; He said:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
&ldquo;&hellip;But I think the whole attitude of the House itself toward the
public service and toward expenditure generally, has undergone a
very material change in the present generation&hellip;. Of course,
the House to this day, in the abstract and in theory, is very
strongly in favor of economy, but I am bound to say that in practice
Members, both in their corporate capacity and, still more, in their
individual capacity, are more disposed to use their influence with
the Executive Government in order to increase expenditure than to
reduce it&hellip;. That is the policy of the House&mdash;to spend more
money than it did, to criticize expenditure less closely than it did,
and to urge the Executive Government to increase expenditure instead
of the reverse.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_424_431" id="FNanchor_424_431" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
   <em>The Commons the Champion of Class Interests</em></div>

<p>Sir Ralph H. Knox,<a href="#Footnote_425_432" id="FNanchor_425_432" class="fnanchor">425</a> who had been in the War Office from 1856 to
1901, and who, for forty years, had listened to the discussions in
Parliament of the Estimates of Expenditure, said:  &ldquo;&hellip;The mass
of speeches that are made in Supply before the House of Commons, are
speeches made on behalf of those who have grievances, their friends or
constituents, or those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
with whom they work, or in whom they are particularly interested. If
you take speech after speech, you find they are simply to the effect:
 &lsquo;we want more&rsquo;&mdash;and they get more&hellip;. In former days there
were more Members who were willing to get up with some pertinence and
some knowledge to criticize those proposals. But I cannot say there has
been any very great tendency in that direction when details are being
discussed&hellip;. What I want, is [someone] to nip in the bud, new
proposals which are made by Members of Parliament very often on behalf
of their constituents. A Member, for instance, represents what I should
call a labor borough; he gets up and proposes that the pay of every
man employed in certain [Government] factories or dockyards should be
increased by so much a week, what I want is somebody to get up and say:
 &lsquo;That is not the view of the country, you must not accept that;&rsquo; but
instead of that the matter goes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub silentio</span>, and the Government,
which is naturally interested in economy and in keeping the expenditure
down, is induced to think if there is any feeling in the House at all,
it is in favor of doubling everybody&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo; Sir R. H. Knox said he
desired more opposition to unwarranted proposals, &ldquo;because I know what
extreme weight is attached to the speeches in Supply by the Minister
in charge of a Department, and by the Department itself; but if they
find that there is not a single man interested in economy when the
details of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the Estimates are discussed, it places them in an exceedingly
difficult position.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_426_433" id="FNanchor_426_433" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Commons Debates weaken Treasury&rsquo;s Hands</em></div>

<p>Sir Edward Hamilton, Assistant Secretary to the Treasury since
1894, said that the Treasury could depend less than formerly upon the
support of the House of Commons, and that often-times the tendency of
the debates in the House was to weaken the hands of the Treasury.<a href="#Footnote_427_434" id="FNanchor_427_434" class="fnanchor">427</a>
Sir Edward Hamilton had entered the Treasury in 1870; had served as
Private Secretary to Mr. Lowe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1872-73;
and as Private Secretary to Mr. Gladstone, First Lord of the Treasury,
in 1880 to 1885. He had been made successively Principal Clerk of the
Finance Division in 1885; Assistant Financial Secretary in 1892; and
Assistant Secretary in 1894. In 1902 he was made Permanent Financial
Secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain, a member of the Select Committee, asked
Mr. R. Chalmers,<a href="#Footnote_428_435" id="FNanchor_428_435" class="fnanchor">428</a> a Principal Clerk at the Treasury: &ldquo;Is it
within your experience as an official of the Treasury that Ministers
of other Departments not infrequently represent, as the reason for
allowing expenditure, the strong pressure that has been put upon them
in the House of Commons?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes; I have seen repeated instances of
that.&rdquo; &ldquo;And their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
inability to resist that pressure for another year?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_429_436" id="FNanchor_429_436" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>Sir John Eldon Gorst, M. P., a man of large experience of the Public
Service, said he had no doubt that in all offices there were officers
who had ceased to have anything to do; and that was particularly
true of the Education Department, where there was much reading of
newspapers, and much literary composition. He had &ldquo;even heard of rooms
where Ping Pong was played, there being nothing else to do at the
moment.&rdquo; Sir John Eldon Gorst continued: &ldquo;The Treasury has power to
make an inquiry into every Office, it could institute an inquiry to
see whether the office was or was not economically managed, but so
far as I know that power never has been exercised. It would be very
difficult indeed for the Parliamentary Head of a Department to call in
the Treasury for such an investigation. It would make the Parliamentary
head extremely unpopular. The only person who, in my opinion, as things
are, can really influence the expenses of an office, is the Civil
Service head&hellip;. But although the Civil Service head of the office
has a very great motive to make his office efficient, because his own
credit and his own future depend on the efficiency of his office, he
has comparatively little motive for economy. Parliament certainly does
not thank him; I do not know whether the Treasury thanks him very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
much; certainly his colleagues do not thank him; &hellip; and the
natural disposition of a man to let well enough alone renders him
reluctant to take upon himself the extremely ungrateful task of
making his office, not only an efficient one, but also an economical
one. I think anybody who has any experience of mercantile offices,
such as a great insurance office, or anything of that kind, would
be struck directly with the different atmosphere which prevails
in a mercantile office and a Government office&hellip;. I have no
hesitation in saying that any large insurance company, or any large
commercial office of any kind, is worked far more efficiently and far
more economically than the best of the Departments of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Government.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_430_437" id="FNanchor_430_437" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p>Sir John Eldon Gorst&rsquo;s statement that he knew of no instance of the
Treasury exercising its power of instituting an inquiry conducted by
Treasury officers, into the administration of a Department of State,
recalls to mind some testimony given by Sir R. E. Welby, Permanent
Secretary to the Treasury, before the Royal Commission on Civil
Establishments, 1888. Mr. Cleghorn, a Member of that Commission, asked
Sir R. E. Welby: &ldquo;Is there anybody at the Treasury, for instance, who
could say to the Board of Trade, or any other particular Department:
 &lsquo;You have too many clerks, you must reduce them by ten?&rsquo; Is there
anybody at the Treasury with sufficient power and knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of the work to be in a position to say that, and to take the
responsibility of it?&rdquo; Sir R. E. Welby replied: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Thereupon
Mr. R. W. Hanbury, another Member of the Commission, asked: &ldquo;There
is not?&rdquo; Once more the answer was: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_431_438" id="FNanchor_431_438" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>Again, in 1876, before the Select Committee on Post Office Telegraph
Departments, Mr. Julian Goldsmid, a Member of the Committee, asked
Mr. S. A. Blackwood, Financial Secretary to the Post Office: &ldquo;You
would not like, perhaps, to give the reasons for that enormous
overmanning which existed in some of the [telegraph] offices [in
1873 to 1875]?&rdquo; Mr. Blackwood replied: &ldquo;I am not acquainted with the
reasons myself.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_432_439" id="FNanchor_432_439" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>Sir Ralph H. Knox, in the course of his testimony, had quoted Mr.
Bagehot&rsquo;s statement: &ldquo;If you want to raise a certain cheer in the
House of Commons, make a general panegyric on economy; if you want to
invite a sure defeat, propose a particular saving.&rdquo; He had continued:
&ldquo;I should like to add, &lsquo;If you want to lose popularity, oppose the
proposals for increase.&rsquo; There ought to be some Members in the House of
Commons who would undertake that line.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gladstone&rsquo;s Tribute to Hume</em></div>

<p>This wish of Sir Ralph H. Knox recalls to mind the tribute paid, in
1873, by Mr. Gladstone, to the memory of Joseph Hume, the first as well
as the last
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Member of the House of Commons to acquire a knowledge of the
expenditures of the Government which was sufficient to enable
the possessor to criticize with intelligence the details of the
expenditures of the Government. Said Mr. Gladstone:
&ldquo;&hellip;and in like manner, I believe that Mr. Hume has earned for
himself an honorable and a prominent place in the history of this
country&mdash;not by endeavoring to pledge Parliament to abstract
resolutions or general declarations on the subject of economy, but
by an indefatigable and unwearied devotion, by the labor of a life,
to obtain complete mastery of all the details of public expenditure,
and by tracking, and I would almost say hunting, the Minister in
every Department through all these details with a knowledge equal or
superior to his own. In this manner, I do not scruple to say, Mr. Hume
did more, not merely to reduce the public expenditure as a matter of
figures, but to introduce principles of economy into the management of
the administration of public money, than all the men who have lived
in our time put together. This is the kind of labor, which, above all
things, we want. I do not know whether my honorable and learned friend
[Mr. Vernon Harcourt], considering his distinguished career in his
profession, is free to devote himself to the public service in the same
way as Mr. Hume did. If, however, he is free to do so, I would say to
him: &lsquo;By all means apply yourself to this vocation. You will find it
extremely disagreeable.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
You will find that during your lifetime very little distinction
is to be gained in it, but in the impartiality of history and of
posterity you will be judged very severely in the scales of absolute
justice as regards the merits of public men, and you will then obtain
your reward.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_433_440" id="FNanchor_433_440" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>The British public, needless to say, still is waiting for the man,
or men, who shall take upon themselves the invidious but honorable
task of stemming the tide to extravagant expenditure, which, in Great
Britain, as elsewhere, is the besetting sin of popular government. The
British people still are waiting, though, since 1870, they have vastly
increased the functions of the Government by nationalizing a great
branch of industry, and therefore are more than ever in need of persons
who shall emulate the late Joseph Hume.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us compare with the testimony given in 1902, the
testimony given in 1873, before the Select Committee on Civil Services
Expenditure.</p>

<p>A Member of the Select Committee of 1873 asked Mr. W. E. Baxter,
Financial Secretary to the Treasury: &ldquo;Am I right in thinking that you
do not agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s declaration with
regard to the Treasury? I asked him this question: &lsquo;Then it is a
popular delusion to believe that the Treasury does exercise a direct
control over the expenditure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
of the Department?&rsquo; And the Chancellor replied: &lsquo;I do not know that it
is popular, but it is a delusion; I think that it would be much more
popular that the Treasury should exercise no control at all.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr.
Baxter replied: &ldquo;I think that the Chancellor stated it too broadly,
and would, probably, if he had been Secretary to the Treasury for
two or three years, have found that the Treasury did, in point of
fact, go back to some extent over the old expenditure as well as try
to stop increases.&rdquo; A moment before, Mr. Baxter had said: &ldquo;The most
unpleasant part, as I find it, of the duty of the Financial Secretary
to the Treasury is to resist the constant pressure brought day by
day, and almost hour by hour, by Members of Parliament, in order to
increase expenditure by increasing the pay of individuals, increasing
the pay of classes, and granting large compensations to individuals
or to classes.&rdquo; The Chairman of the Committee queried: &ldquo;And that
pressure, which is little known to the public, has given you, and your
predecessors in office, I presume, a great deal of thought and a great
deal of concern?&rdquo; Mr. Baxter replied: &ldquo;As I said before, it is the most
unpleasant part of my duties, and it occupies a very great deal of time
which probably might be better spent.&rdquo; At this point Mr. Sclater-Booth
asked: &ldquo;You spoke of the constant Parliamentary pressure which has been
exercised with a view to increasing salaries or compensations, do you
allude to proceedings in Parliament as well as private communications,
or only to the latter?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Mr. Baxter replied: &ldquo;I did in my answer only allude to private
communications by letter and conversation in the House, because that
was in my mind at the time. But of course my answer might be extended
to those motions in the House which are resisted without effect by
the Government, and which entail great expenditure upon the country.&rdquo;
Mr. Herman queried: &ldquo;When you speak of the pressure put upon you by
Members of Parliament for the increase of pay to classes, and the other
points that you named, I suppose that you mean that it is partly party
pressure, and that you are more subject to it at the present time than
you would be if a Conservative Government were in power?&rdquo; Mr. Baxter
replied: &ldquo;In my experience it has very little to do with party; men
from all quarters of the House are at me from week to week.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you
mean to say that men opposed to you in political principles apply to
you for that sort of thing now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly I should wish it to be
distinctly understood that they do not ask this as a favor; they do not
ask favors of me. They simply wish me to look into the question of the
pay of individuals and of classes of individuals, as they put it, with
a view of benefitting the public service&hellip;. In very few instances
since I have been Financial Secretary to the Treasury have I been
asked by anyone to advance a friend, or to do anything in the shape
of a favor. The representations are of this sort: &lsquo;Here are a class of
public officers who are underpaid. We wish you to look into the matter,
and to consider
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
whether or not it would be advantageous to the public service that
their salary should be increased.&rsquo; I look into it, and I say that I am
not at all of that opinion, upon which my friend tells me that he will
bring the matter before the House, and show us up.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the other evil
is one which is rapidly diminishing, and, in fact, is very small now,
namely, interference in favor of individuals?&rdquo; &ldquo;Very small indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To a question from Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Baxter replied: &ldquo;I do not think
that the representations in question have much effect; I only stated
that the most unpleasant part of my duties was resisting the pressure
brought to bear in that way.&rdquo; Thereupon Mr. Rathbone continued: &ldquo;They
may not have an effect when the Government has a majority of one
hundred or so, or when there is no election impending, but do you
think they have no effect when, as we have seen in former years for
long periods, the Government is carried on, whether by one side or the
other, by a very small majority, or when an election is impending?&rdquo;
Mr. Baxter replied: &ldquo;I have no doubt that they have had the effect
in former times in those circumstances.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you think they would be
liable to have that effect again if either party should be reduced to
that condition?&rdquo; &ldquo;It may be so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you suggest any mode of abating
the Parliamentary pressure to which you have alluded, whether it be
exercised by public motions or by private influence?&rdquo; The Financial
Secretary to the Treasury replied: &ldquo;No; it is an evil very difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
to remedy. I think the better plan would be to inform the
constituencies on the subject and let them know the practice which
so widely prevails, in order that, if inclined to take the side of
economy, they may look after their Members of Parliament.&rdquo; A moment
later, Mr. Sclater-Booth asked: &ldquo;Do you not think from what you have
seen of the public service, that the Treasury, existing particularly
for that purpose, is the body which must be permanently relied upon
to keep down expenditure?&rdquo; &ldquo;Decidedly so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even the constituencies
can scarcely, as a rule, be appealed to in that sense, can they?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No; I attach very much more importance to the power of the Treasury
than either to the action of the House of Commons, or, I am sorry to
say, to the voice of the constituencies.&rdquo;<a href="#Footnote_434_441" id="FNanchor_434_441" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">
   CHAPTER XIX <br /><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span>
</h2>

<p>A large and ever increasing number of us are adherents of the
political theory that the extension of the functions of the State to
the inclusion of the conduct of business ventures will purify politics
and make the citizen take a more intelligent as well as a more active
part in public affairs. The verdict of the experience of Great Britain
under the public ownership and operation of the telegraphs is that that
doctrine is untenable. Instead of purifying politics, public ownership
has corrupted them. It has given a great impetus to class bribery, a
form of corruption far more insidious than individual bribery. With one
exception, wherever the public ownership of the telegraphs has affected
the pocket-book interests of any considerable body of voters, the
good-will of those voters has been gained at the expense of the public
purse. The only exception has been the policy pursued toward the owners
of the telephone patents; and even in that case the policy adopted was
not dictated by legitimate motives.</p>

<p>The nationalization of the telegraphs was initiated with class
bribery. The telegraph companies had been poor politicians, and had
failed to conciliate the newspaper
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
press by allowing the newspapers to organize their own news bureaux.
The Government played the game of politics much better; it gave the
newspapers a tariff which its own advisor, Mr. Scudamore, said would
prove unprofitable. No subsequent Government has attempted to abrogate
the bargain, though the annual loss to the State now is upward of
$1,500,000.</p>

<p>The promise to extend the telegraphs to every place with a money
order issuing Post Office was given in ignorance of what it would
cost to carry out that promise. But the adherence to the policy until
an anticipated expenditure of $1,500,000 had risen to $8,500,000 was
nothing more nor less than the purchase of votes out of the public
purse. Not until 1873 did the Government abandon the policy that
every place with a money order issuing Post Office was entitled to
telegraphic service.</p>

<p>When the House of Commons, in March, 1883, against the protests of
the Government passed the resolution which demanded that the tariff on
telegrams be cut almost in two, the Government should have resigned
rather than carry out the order. The Government&rsquo;s obedience to an order
which the Government itself contended would put a heavy burden on the
taxpayer for four years, was nothing more nor less than the purchase of
Parliamentary support out of the public purse. No serious argument had
been advanced that the charge of 24 cents for 20 words was excessive.
The argument of the leader of the movement for reduction, Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Cameron, of Glasgow, was a worthy complement to the argument made
in 1868 by Mr. Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to wit, that
telegraphing ought to be made so cheap that the illiterate man who
could not write a letter would send a telegram. Dr. Cameron argued
that &ldquo;instead of maintaining a price which was prohibitory not only to
the working classes but also to the middle classes, they ought to take
every means to encourage telegraphy. They ought to educate the rising
generation to it; and he would suggest to the Government that the
composing of telegrams would form a useful part of the education in our
board schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parliament after Parliament, and Government after Government has
purchased out of the public purse the good-will of the telegraph
employees. Organized in huge civil servants&rsquo; unions, the telegraph
employees have been permitted to establish the policy that wages and
salaries shall be fixed in no small degree by the amount of political
pressure that the telegraph employees can bring to bear on Members of
the House of Commons. With the rest of the Government employees they
have been permitted to establish the doctrine that once a man has
landed himself on the State&rsquo;s pay-roll, he has &ldquo;something very nearly
approaching to a freehold of provision for life,&rdquo; irrespective of
his fitness and his amenableness to discipline, and no matter what
labor-saving machines may be invented, or how much business may fall
off. To a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
degree the State employees have established their demand that
promotion be made according to seniority rather than merit. In more
than one Postmaster General have they instilled &ldquo;a perfect horror of
passing anyone over.&rdquo; Turning to one part of the service, one finds
the civil service unions achieving the revocation of the promotion
of the man denominated &ldquo;probably the ablest man in the Sheffield
Post Office.&rdquo; Turning to another part of the service, one finds the
Postmaster General, Mr. Raikes, &ldquo;for the good of the service&rdquo; telling
an exceptionally able man that &ldquo;he can well afford to wait his
turn.&rdquo; The civil servants, in the telegraph service and elsewhere,
to a considerable degree have secured to themselves exemption from
the rigorous discipline to which must submit the people who are in
the service of private individuals and of companies. Finally, the
civil servants have been permitted to establish to a greater or a
lesser degree a whole host of demands that are inconsistent with the
economical conduct of business. Among them may be mentioned the demand
that the standard of efficiency may not be raised without reimbursement
to those who take the trouble to come up to the new standard; that
if a man enters the service when the proportion of higher officers
to the rank and file is 1 to 10, he has &ldquo;an implied contract&rdquo; with
the Government that that proportion shall not be altered to his
disadvantage though it may be altered to his advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>Public opinion has compelled the great Political Parties to drop
Party politics with regard to the State employees, and to give them
security of tenure of office. But it permits the State employees to
engage in Party politics towards Members of Parliament. The civil
service unions watch the speeches and votes of Members of the House of
Commons, and send speakers and campaign workers into the districts of
offending Members. In the election campaigns they ask candidates to
pledge themselves to support in Parliament civil servants&rsquo; demands.
Their political activities have led Mr. Hanbury, Financial Secretary
to the Treasury in 1895 to 1900, to say: &ldquo;We must recognize the fact
that in this House of Commons, public servants have a Court of Appeal
such as exists with regard to no private employee whatever. It is a
Court of Appeal which exists not only with regard to the grievances of
classes, and even of individuals, but it is a Court of Appeal which
applies even to the wages and duties of classes and individuals, and
its functions in that respect are only limited by the common sense
of Members, who should exercise caution in bringing forward cases
of individuals, because, if political influence is brought to bear
in favor of one individual, the chances are that injury is done to
some other individual&hellip;. We have done away with personal and
individual bribery, but there is still a worse form of bribery, and
that is when a man asks a candidate [for Parliament] to buy his vote
out of the public purse.&rdquo; The tactics
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
employed by civil servants have led the late Postmaster General,
Lord Stanley, to apply the terms &ldquo;blackmail&rdquo; and &ldquo;blood-sucking.&rdquo;
The conduct of the House of Commons under civil service pressure has
led Mr. A. J. Balfour, the late Premier, to express grave anxiety
concerning the future of Great Britain&rsquo;s civil service. It has led
Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Representative of the Postmaster General, to
say that Members of both Parties had come to him seeking protection
from the demands made upon them by the civil servants. On another
occasion it has led Mr. Chamberlain to say: &ldquo;In a great administration
like this there must be decentralization, and how difficult it is to
decentralize, either in the Post Office or in the Army, when working
under constant examination by question and answer in this House, no
Honorable Member who has not had experience of official life can easily
realize. But there must be decentralization, because every little petty
matter cannot be dealt with by the Postmaster General or the Permanent
Secretary to the Post Office. Their attention should be reserved in
the main for large questions, and I think it is deplorable, absolutely
deplorable, that so much of their time should be occupied, as under the
present circumstances it necessarily is occupied, with matters of very
small detail because these matters of detail are asked by Honorable
Members and because we do not feel an Honorable Member will accept an
answer from anyone but the highest authority. I think a third of the
time&mdash;I am putting it at a low
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
estimate&mdash;of the highest officials in the Post Office is occupied
in answering questions raised by Members of this House, and in
providing me with information in order that I may be in a position
to answer the inquiries addressed to me&rdquo; about matters which &ldquo;in any
private business would be dealt with by the officer on the spot,
without appeal or consideration unless grievous cause were shown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The questions of which Mr. Austen Chamberlain spoke, at one end
of the scale are put on behalf of a man discharged for theft, at the
other end of the scale on behalf of the man who fears he will not be
promoted. The practice of putting such questions not only leads to
deplorable waste of executive ability, it also modifies profoundly the
entire administration of the public service. Lord Welby, the highest
authority in Great Britain, in 1902 testified that it was the function
of the Treasury to hold the various Departments up to efficient and
economical administration. But that the debates in the Commons not
only weakened the Treasury&rsquo;s control over the several Departments, but
also made the Treasury lower its standards of efficiency and economy.
He added that in the last twenty or twenty-five years both Parties
had lost a great deal of &ldquo;the old spirit of economy,&rdquo; and that at the
same time &ldquo;the effective power of control in the Chancellor of the
Exchequer had been proportionately diminished.&rdquo; In former times the
Chancellor of the Exchequer had been &ldquo;paramount, or very powerful in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Cabinet.&rdquo; Upon the same occasion, Sir George H. Murray was called to
testify, because &ldquo;in the official posts he had held, particularly as
Private Secretary to the late Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, he had
had frequent opportunities for observation not only of the reasons for
expenditure, but of the control exercised over it in Parliament.&rdquo; Sir
George H. Murray said: &ldquo;But I think the whole attitude of the House
itself toward the public service and toward expenditure generally, has
undergone a very material change in the present generation&hellip;.
Of course, the House to this day, in the abstract and in theory, is
very strongly in favor of economy, but I am bound to say that in
practice Members, both in their corporate capacity and, still more, in
their individual capacity, are more disposed to use their influence
with the Executive Government in order to increase expenditure than
to reduce it.&rdquo; Sir John Eldon Gorst testified in 1902: &ldquo;But although
the Civil Service head of the office has a very great motive to make
his office efficient, because his own credit and his future depend on
the efficiency of his office, he has comparatively little motive for
economy. Parliament certainly does not thank him; and I do not know
whether the Treasury thanks him very much; certainly his colleagues
do not thank him&hellip;. I think anybody who has any experience of
mercantile offices, such as a great insurance office, or anything of
that kind, would be struck directly with the different atmosphere which
prevails in a mercantile office and a Government
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
office&hellip;. I have no hesitation in saying that any large insurance
company, or any large commercial office of any kind is worked far more
efficiently and far more economically than the best of the Departments
of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir John Eldon Gorst might have added that the Civil Service head of
a Department really had only rather moderate power to enforce economy.
Before the Royal Commission of 1888, Lord Welby [then Sir Welby],
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, was asked: &ldquo;But you would hardly
plead the interference of Members of Parliament as a justification for
not getting rid of an unworthy servant, would you?&rdquo; Lord Welby, who had
been in the Treasury since 1856, replied: &ldquo;It is not a good reason,
but as a matter of fact it is powerful. The House of Commons are our
masters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the hands of a commercial company, the telegraphs in the United
Kingdom would yield a handsome return even upon their present cost to
the Government. That is proven beyond the possibility of controversy by
the figures presented in the preceding chapters. In the hands of the
State, in the period from 1892-93 to 1905-06, the operating expenses
alone have exceeded the gross receipts by $1,435,000. If one excludes,
as not earned by the telegraphs, the $8,552,000 paid the Government
by the National Telephone Company in the form of royalties for the
privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
of conducting the telephone business in competition with the State&rsquo;s
telegraphs, the excess of operating expenses over gross receipts will
become $9,987,000. That sum, of course, takes no account of the large
sums required annually to pay the interest and depreciation charges
upon the capital invested in the telegraph plant.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1906, the capital invested in the telegraphs was
$84,812,000. To raise that capital, the Government had sold $54,300,000
of 3 per cent. securities, at an average price of about 92.3; and for
the rest the Government had drawn upon the current revenue raised by
taxation. On March 31, 1906, the unearned interest which the Government
had paid upon the aforesaid $54,300,000 of securities had aggregated
$22,530,000, the equivalent of 26.5 per cent. of the capital invested
in the telegraphs. Upon the $30,500,000 taken from the current revenue,
the Government never has had any return whatever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The nationalization of the telegraphs has corrupted British politics
by giving a great impetus to the insidious practice of class bribery.
It also has placed heavy burdens upon the taxpayers. But that is not
all. The public ownership of the telegraphs has resulted in the State
deliberately hampering the development of the telephone industry. That
industry, had the Government let it alone, would have grown to enormous
proportions, promoting the convenience and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
prosperity of the business community, as well as giving employment to
tens of thousands of people. In the year 1906, only one person in each
105 persons in the United Kingdom was a subscriber to the telephone;
and the total of persons employed in the telephone industry was only
some 20,000. On January 1, 1907, one person in each 20 persons in the
United States was a subscriber to the telephone.</p>

<p>Under the telephone policy pursued by the Government, the National
Telephone Company down to the close of the year 1896 for all practical
purposes had no right to erect a pole in a street or lay a wire under a
street. As late as 1898, not less than 120,000 miles of the company&rsquo;s
total of 140,000 miles of wire were strung from house-top to house-top,
under private way-leaves which the owners of the houses had the right
to terminate on six months&rsquo; notice. Inadequate as it was, the progress
made by the National Telephone Company down to 1898 was a splendid
tribute to British enterprise.</p>

<p>The necessarily unsatisfactory service given by the National
Telephone Company, down to the close of 1898, created a prejudice
against the use of the telephone which to this day has not been
completely overcome. Again, the Government to this day has left the
National Telephone Company in such a position of weakness, that the
Company has been unable to brave public opinion to the extent of
abolishing the unlimited user tariff and establishing the measured
service tariff
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
exclusively. On the other hand, it is an admitted fact that the
telephone cannot be brought into very extensive use except on the basis
of the measured service exclusively.</p>

<p>The British Government embarked in the telegraph business, thus
putting itself in the position of a trader. But it refused subsequently
to assume one of the commonest risks to which every trader is exposed,
the liability to have his property impaired in value, if not destroyed,
by inventions and new ways of doing things. In that respect the British
Government has pursued the same policy that the British Municipalities
have pursued. The latter bodies first hampered the spread of the
electric light, in large part for the purpose of protecting the
municipal gas plants; and subsequently they hampered the spread of the
so-called electricity-in-bulk generating companies, which threatened to
drive out of the field the local municipal electric light plants.</p>

<p>Very recently the British Government has taken measures to
protect its telegraphs and its long distance telephone service from
competition from wireless telegraphy. It has refused an application
for a license made by a company that proposed to establish a wireless
telegraphy service between certain English cities. The refusal was
made &ldquo;on the ground that the installations are designed for the
purpose of establishing exchanges which would be in contravention of
the Postmaster General&rsquo;s ordinary telegraphic monopoly.&rdquo; In order to
protect its property in the submarine cables
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
to France, Belgium, Holland and Germany, the Government has inserted in
the &ldquo;model wireless telegraphy license&rdquo; a prohibition of the sending or
receiving of international telegrams, &ldquo;either directly or by means of
any intermediate station or stations, whether on shore or on a ship at
sea.&rdquo; In short, the commercial use of wireless telegraphy apparatus the
Government has limited to communication with vessels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one respect the nationalization of the telegraphs has fulfilled
the promises made by the advocates of nationalization. It has increased
enormously the use of the telegraphs. But when the eminent economist,
Mr. W. S. Jevons, came to consider what the popularization of the
telegraphs had cost the taxpayers, he could not refrain from adding
that a large part of the increased use made of the telegraphs was of
such a nature that the State could have no motive for encouraging
it. &ldquo;Men have been known to telegraph for a pocket handkerchief,&rdquo;
was his closing comment. Mr. Jevons had been an ardent advocate of
nationalization. Had he lived to witness the corruption of politics
produced by the public ownership of the telegraphs, his disillusionment
would have been even more complete.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From whatever viewpoint one examines the outcome of the
nationalization of the telegraphs, one finds invariably that experience
proves the unsoundness of the doctrine that the extension of the
functions of the State
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
to the inclusion of the conduct of business ventures will purify
politics and make the citizen take a more intelligent as well as a more
active part in public affairs. Class bribery has been the outcome,
wherever the State as the owner of the telegraphs has come in conflict
with the pocket-book interest of the citizen. One reason has been that
the citizen has not learned to act on the principle of subordinating
his personal interest to the interest of the community as a whole.
Another reason has been that the community as a whole has not learned
to take the pains to ascertain its interests, and to protect them
against the illegitimate demands made by classes or sections of the
community. There is no body of intelligent and disinterested public
opinion to which can appeal for support the Member of Parliament who
is pressed to violate the public interest, but wishes to resist the
pressure. The policy of State intervention and State ownership does
not create automatically that eternal vigilance which is the price not
only of liberty but also of good government. One may go further, and
say that the verdict of British experience is that it is more difficult
to safeguard and promote the public interest under the policy of State
intervention than under the policy of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span>. Under the degree
of political intelligence and public and private virtue that have
existed in Great Britain since 1868, no public service company could
have violated the permanent interests of the people in the way in which
the National Government and the Municipalities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
have violated them since they have become the respective owners of
the telegraphs and the municipal public service industries. No public
service company could have blocked the progress of a rival in the way
in which the Government has blocked the progress of the telephone.
No combination of capital could have exercised such control over
Parliament and Government as the Association of Municipal Corporations
has exercised. Finally, no combination of capital could have violated
the public interest in such manner as the civil service unions have
done.</p>
